Mercifully, everywhere you look nowadays, people of conscience seem to be popping up within the ANC. For all the craven conspiracy theorists like Nomvula Mokonyane and Malusi Gigaba, people with admirable ethics, such as Jackson Mthembu and Aaron Motsoaledi, are speaking out. Now you can add Yunus Carrim to the mix. Carrim, the ANC MP who chairs parliament’s standing committee on finance, became yet another to defy Jacob Zuma. The president, in another ill-considered move, this week referred the Financial Intelligence Centre Bill back to parliament for "constitutional reasons". Perhaps his actions were predictable, as the bill would have made it harder for the rent-seekers and state capturers to hide their loot. Already the president’s friends, the Guptas, have been axed by the big four banks as they are understood to have posed a money-laundering risk. Tougher money-laundering rules would never fly. Carrim, however, refused to back down, telling News24 that "parliament is not going to tremble and buckle just because the president’s lawyers said it’s unconstitutional". Parliament’s lawyers said it passed muster, and both houses had already approved it. At this point, it seems to have been a rather craven bid by Zuma to protect his friends. Carrim has shown he’s not going to be bullied.
