WHERE: Colesberg, Karoo PRICE: R50mGary Player s Karoo stud farm Rietfontein is on the market, more than 40 years after the golfing legend acquired the property. It is located on the Oorlogspoort River just outside Colesberg. Player and his wife Vivienne made Rietfontein their permanent home after completing the main residence in 2006. Designed by Philip Watermeyer, the homestead pays tribute to the traditional Karoo building style with its stone plinths, stark white walls, black roof and extensive use of natural materials. The residence features a basement wine cellar, an ultramodern kitchen with Larchwood cupboards, a walk-in cold room, an upstairs library, a private study and a gym. A nine-hole golf course is on the property.Agents: Chas Everitt InternationalWHERE: Mount Edgecombe, Umhlanga PRICE: R45mIn the centre of this golf estate lies a spacious, elegant home that offers seven en-suite bedrooms, four of which lead onto a wraparound balcony overlooking the garden.
