It was third time lucky for Ghana’s president-elect, Nana Akufo-Addo, after the electoral commission declared his New Patriotic Party had won 54% of the vote to 44% for John Mahama’s ruling National Democratic Congress. Akufo-Addo, scion of Ghanaian royalty and the political establishment, lost in 2008 and 2012. He tweeted: “A few minutes ago I received a call from President @JDMahama congratulating me on winning the 2016 presidential election. #ChangeHasCome.” All good for democracy. Only someone with presidential protection and the hide of a buffalo could have taken to the role of SABC dictator-in-chief with such alacrity. But the Hlaudi Motsoeneng wrecking ball may just have been checked. The Western Cape high court ruled that he was unlawfully made group executive of corporate affairs and ordered his suspension. Over at parliament, former colleagues ripped into his crude and ruthless management style at an inquiry into the crumbling SABC. What will his next ruse be to hang in there?
