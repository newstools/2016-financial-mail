Some homeowners have made little, if any, money on their residential bricks and mortar investments over the past five years. Though there isn’t a single suburb in the bigger metros where prices have fallen (in nominal terms), Lightstone’s data reveals that house prices in a number of suburbs across Cape Town, Johannesburg and Pretoria have increased by less than 3% in the five years to the end of June. The bulk of the worst performers fall into the lower end of the market, where properties typically sell for between R700,000 and R1.5m (see graphic). The list includes a number of suburbs in Strand and the Gordon’s Bay area near Somerset West on the outskirts of Cape Town, the Roodepoort region on the West Rand, Centurion south of Pretoria, as well as Pretoria’s northern Akasia region. Lightstone analytics director Paul-Roux de Kock says low capital growth doesn’t necessarily mean an area has gone into decline. "Prices tend to stabilise in suburbs that have experienced a period of strong growth, as buyers start to gravitate to other areas that offer better value.’’ This can be particularly true for the lower end of the market, where buyers tend to be extremely price-sensitive. Other reasons that can affect price growth in any suburb include a sudden increase in crime and grime, disrupting developments such as road infrastructure and large shopping centres, and an oversupply of stock. The latter is particularly prevalent in growth nodes where a flurry of new townhouse and cluster developments can cause a temporary supply/demand mismatch — Centurion and the West Rand being cases in point.
