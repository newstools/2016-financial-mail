Imraan Valodia: Changing the balance of power. Picture: FREDDY MAVUNDANobody can accuse Prof Imraan Valodia, who chairs SA s national minimum wage panel, of not knowing what it feels like to earn below the minimum wage.The Wits University dean worked alongside poor construction workers in India in the mid-2000s to better understand the dynamics of low-income households.He remembers being puzzled when they pushed for a higher minimum wage since their employers were ignoring the legislated amount. They reasoned, however, that a higher legal minimum would put moral pressure on noncompliant employers to raise their meagre wages a bit too.He hopes the same thing will happen in SA if the panel s recommendation of a R20/hour minimum wage (or R3,440/month) is accepted by government."We need to change the discourse in SA so every worker knows they should get R20 an hour," he says. "It significantly changes the balance of power in the bargaining relationship."The introduction of a national minimum wage (NMW) provides a unique chance to address SA s working poor problem, given that almost half of all workers earn less than R3,500/month.But the panel also accepts that if the NMW is set too high, it s the most vulnerable workers who are most at risk of losing their jobs.The panel is "absolutely convinced" that at R20/hour, any disemployment effects will not exceed the benefits to low-paid workers.The number is intended to be just below the threshold where the effects on employment change from benign to negative.Economists are having a hard time swallowing this, however, given that the panel has no cost-benefit analysis to back up this assertion and has rejected as outliers the economic models developed by Wits University and the University of Cape Town (UCT).UCT found that a minimum wage of R3,400 could cause more than half a million job losses. But the panel didn t wholly buy into UCT s model, which predicts that the only firm-level response to an increase in wages is to reduce the number of jobs.It accepted Wits proposition that rising wages could also generate positive effects by raising workers productivity and purchasing power. But it didn t wholly share Wits conclusion that faster growth would follow without significant job losses."The panel is of the view that these models provide the outer bounds of the impact of the national minimum wage, and that the true effect will include elements of both predictions," says Valodia.So how did the panel arrive at the precise value of R3,440/month in the absence of an agreed model?"The panel carefully considered all of the evidence, debated the issues at length and reached what we believe to be a carefully considered level," states the report.In other words, an educated guess.Academic economist Dave Kaplan accuses the panel of having failed to do its job."This was a chance for a group of experts to put some numbers on the table so that the trade-offs would be made explicit, policy could become informed and so that it would stop being a political football," he says. "Instead, the panel produced a fudge."In the end, consensus was reached through a negotiated agreement.Valodia says that the fears of those panellists who felt that R20/hour was too high were assuaged by the accommodating transition arrangements, exemptions, and tiered wage levels proposed for domestic and farm workers. Importantly, employers will have until July 2019 to make the shift. By then, the real value of the NMW will be closer to R3,000/month based on projected inflation something that the unions will not be happy about.Organised business is not too happy, either. Though micro businesses are given an extra year to comply, no exception is made for start-ups, those small, labour-intensive firms on which job creation and growth depends.Big business and big unions, on the other hand, will remain untouched by the NMW, argues Nomura economist Peter Attard Montalto. And by increasing the relative cost of labour, the capital-intensive nature of SA s growth path will be reinforced.His expectation is that hiring rates may drop, the hours worked per employee and nonwage benefits may fall, while the cost of the NMW will probably get passed on through lower dividends, a lower tax take or higher prices to consumers."If everyone s unhappy, we ve done our job," says Valodia. "My sense is that there s broad acceptance. I d be surprised if the number changes."
