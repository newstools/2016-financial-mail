Picture: REUTERSThe death of former Cuban president Fidel Castro has closed a complicated chapter. Reaction to his passing was, as you d expect, mixed: condemned as a tyrant by his own daughter (who fled to the US), he was also lauded, even worshipped, as a saint-like liberator by many developing nations.For Cubans, there s no dispute that his human rights record was abysmal: executions were rife while thousands were jailed for daring to call for similar freedoms we take for granted in SA like basic freedom of expression.Africans have a more romantic notion of Castro. Certainly, as a symbol, there s no debate he was instrumental in the demise of apartheid and colonialism.While the UK and the US, at worst, tacitly supported apartheid, Castro overtly supported Africa s liberation movements. So Cuba provided military support to African guerrilla forces and committed troops to fight the SA Defence Force s assault on a free Angola. This led SA to withdraw from Angola and Namibia, hastening an end to minority rule. To the oppressed, Castro was a net positive.Cuba also supplied doctors to prop up SA s health-care system but many were keen to leave anyway, as they earned less than R1,000 per month at home,This illustrates the point: economically, Cuba was a disaster. But as a symbol for African liberation, Castro was an icon.
