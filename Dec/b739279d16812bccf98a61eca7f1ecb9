Fitbit s latest wearables are likely to feature prominently on December wish lists.The 2015 Charge HR model was one of their most popular wearables.The 2016 update is the Charge 2, with a slightly more chic design and some nice new features mostly relating to personalisation and goals.The Charge 2 tracks steps and calories, distance covered, floors climbed, active minutes, as well as hourly activity and stationary time. These are viewable as up-to-the-minute daily stats on the OLED display, which is larger than that of the Charge HR and also shows the time.It vibrates when you receive calls (from your linked smartphone), there are calendar alerts and it displays message notifications.Sleep tracking is incorporated, and so is a silent vibrating alarm.You ll have to charge your device every five days.I like the multisport tracking function that lets you get data on activities such as yoga and weight training.And there is SmartTrack, which automatically records certain activities such as biking and hiking even if you don t log them.The Fitbit app is one of the nicer ones out there attractive and user-friendly, allowing you to make the most of your device. Using the app, you can now enjoy benefits such as guided relaxation sessions focusing on breathing (prompting breathing rate based on your heart rate) and get information about your heart s fitness with a personalised cardio fitness score.The Charge 2 will set you back R2,999.Fitbit Charge 2 Cool factor: ***** Usability: ***** Value for money: ***
