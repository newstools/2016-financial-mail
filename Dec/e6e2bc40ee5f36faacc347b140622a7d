Horse racing is an ancient sport that stretches back to antiquity and has long been known as the sport of kings. Some racing festivals are the social highlights of the year in the countries that host them, such as the Royal Ascot in the UK, the Melbourne Cup in Australia and the Qatar Goodwood Festival. In SA, the Durban July and the J&B Met have that cachet, but now the L’Ormarins Queen’s Plate (LQP) at Kenilworth looks set to become the premier racing event of the year. The LQP has introduced an additional day of races and will be run on Friday and Saturday, January 6-7. The Saturday event will follow the traditional format of 10 races, from 11am to 11pm, that will also include the L’Ormarins Queen’s Plate, which has a R1m purse. The new addition on Friday will have eight races, starting at 12pm, and will include the prestigious Sceptre Stakes. This year, to mark the changes, the organisers will be hosting an inaugural LQP garden party, which is limited to just 500 guests.
