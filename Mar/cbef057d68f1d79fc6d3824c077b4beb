Multitude of choices: Many consequences for advertising and beyond. Picture: THINKSTOCKTELEVISION has moved from being the hero in the living room to being a background option competing with other devices.The Media Shop s latest newsletter says a study by the UK Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB) indicates that connected devices now compete equally and increasingly with TV for attention, and that this has changed traditional viewing habits. The study says 50% of UK adult online users report the TV set remains the focal point of their living room, while 70% say they use a connected device while watching TV.While watching TV programmes, more than a third of viewers check e-mails, 31% look at instant or text messages and 25% shop online.Notes IAB chief strategy officer Tim Elkington: Second screening is ingrained to such a degree that all screens are now equal; there s no hierarchy, only fragmentation of attention. He believes entertainment is only a small part of the living room media activity. It s a multifunctional space, where people jump between individual and group activities, be it shopping, social media, e-mail, work or messaging. Furthermore, says the study, the declining kettle power surge during ad breaks in peak TV times observed over the past 25 years provides more evidence of the change in the traditional rhythm of the living room.
