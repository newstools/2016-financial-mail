Hillary Clinton. Picture: REUTERSOnly 11 days before the US election, news that the FBI would reopen its investigation into Hillary Clinton s use of a private e-mail server has thrown projections of her easy elevation to the US presidency into disarray.On the face of it, Clinton s use of a private e-mail address to send e-mails as diverse as planning her daughter s wedding to the 2012 attack on the US embassy in Benghazi is an obvious breach of security protocol.It has also showcased her biggest liability when she can least afford it, a bitter pill for an electorate which keeps saying it doesn t trust Clinton. Clinton, this evidence suggests, plays by her own rules.Of course, were she facing a stronger candidate than Donald Trump a racist, xenophobic narcissist this latest revelation could be fatal to her prospects.But let s be clear: Trump would be the worst option imaginable. His election would embolden anti-immigrant parties in the EU, and advance nationalist leaders (like Brexit-ers) who want to withdraw into themselves. At home, his tax cuts, increased military spending and new barriers to trade would trash the US economy. He would make America hate again.Clinton may not have shown that she has the makings of a president. But she has the experience, courage, prudence and dignity to hold office. And crucially, the other way, madness lies.
