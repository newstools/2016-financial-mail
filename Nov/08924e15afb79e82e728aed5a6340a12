Trustco Founder and MD Quinton van Rooyen. Picture: RUSSELL ROBERTSNamibian investment company Trustco has dramatically altered the terms of a controversial R3.6bn diamond mining deal which is still awaiting approval from mining authorities.In late 2015 Trustco proposed buying diamond mining and gem polishing assets, held under Huso and Morse. It was a related-party deal because the assets were owned by CEO Quinton van Rooyen, who will get new Trustco shares as payment.It s a risky deal because the "paper" value of the diamond assets which have no meaningful profit history or solid tangible asset underpin are worth more than Trustco s R2.3bn market capitalisation.Now Trustco has amended the deal with Van Rooyen. The price tag and initial upfront scrip payment of N$672m is retained, but the terms of the st aggered performance-based issue of scrip has been changed.A fixed number of shares will be issued to Van Rooyen during the nine-year payment term. The profit projections of the combined diamond assets are N$250m of Ebitda in four unspecified trading periods in exchange for 120m Trustco shares each time the profit target is reached. An Ebitda target of N$308m will trigger the issuing of 148m shares.The forecast earnings for the mining assets are nearly triple the market cap of JSE-listed diamond miner Trans Hex.
