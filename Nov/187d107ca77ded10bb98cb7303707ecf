Luke Dale-Roberts and members of his team in action Since Luke Dale-Roberts opened The Test Kitchen at the Old Biscuit Mill in Cape Town in 2010, it has appeared on the Eat Out Top 10 every year. This year it occupies the 22nd position on the San Pellegrino World s 50 Best Restaurants list.So changing a winning formula is a bold move. Dale-Roberts has reinvented The Test Kitchen by adding a Dark Room and a Light Room.The new dining areas are open only for dinners and can take a maximum of 40 guests. The Dark Room is a luxuriously dark space where diners can enjoy cocktails and the first seven courses of the tasting menu. The Light Room is airier and more formal. Here guests will enjoy the remainder of the beautifully plated tasting menu in a more formal setting.Dale-Roberts jokes his staff have become "Tweezer Chefs" because of the detail required for each dish. Dinner only, Tuesday to Saturday: 7pm- 9.30pm. www.thetestkitchen.co.za.
