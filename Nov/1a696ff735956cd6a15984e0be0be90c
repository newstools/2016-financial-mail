Picture: ISTOCKVehicle tracking and fleet management specialist Cartrack is mulling a more conservative dividend policy. Will this stall sentiment? The market looks a little pensive at this delicate juncture, with indications that the targeted dividend cover of between 1.25 and 1.55 times headline earnings could be revised to provide for cover of between 1.25 and 2.5 times headline earnings.The pegged interim payout of 20c/share was covered 1.9 times by headline earnings of 38c/share, and indications are that the final dividend cover for the 2017 financial year will range between 1.75 and 2.5 times headline earnings.Investors will probably debate the dividend decision at length.Seen against the rapid downturn in Cartrack s African businesses, the conservative dividend policy signals some bumpy miles ahead. There is also the recent foray into the US, which will take some time to reach break-even at cash flow level. The US venture only starts selling this month and the first meaningful revenues will only flow through in the 2017 financial year.I wonder, however, if the dividend track-back might not signal bigger ambitions on the acquisition front. There has been some consolidation globally in the vehicle tracking and fleet management segment, and there must be opportunities for Cartrack to bolt on a deal or three.I must confess I can t stop thinking that Cartrack should be tailing JSE rival MiX Telematics it s a deal that, I reckon, could be mutually beneficial, especially in terms of increasing traction in offshore markets.Brittle sentimentThe market seems awfully nervous about aluminium products specialist Hulamin. A solid trading update hardly moved the share price, and I m starting to get tempted, even though the industrial landscape in SA remains frighteningly rugged in some parts.Hulamin has already posted basic earnings and headline earnings of 48c/share for the six months to end-June but it notes that production performance and sales improved further in the third quarter of the 2016 financial year on the levels attained in the first half of the year . The same goes for the all-important conversion margins and manufacturing costs.What s more, sales of can body stock have increased in the third quarter (after a subdued first half), and so has the purchase of can scrap metal (for reprocessing into aluminium can stock).Even though the rand is a little more robust, Hulamin reckons earnings and headline earnings should be at least 20% higher than last year. That means the company should post earnings and headline earnings of about 61c/share and 44c/share.Yes, a further strengthening of the rand could be a factor in the last quarter of the financial year.But even a worst-case exchange-rate scenario should not detract from a bottom-line figure that makes Hulamin s current market rating look more than a little modest. This could well be one for the bottom drawer.Raise you oneSo the proponents behind the offer to buy out minority shareholders in boutique hotel group Gooderson have upped their price.Maybe the trust controlled by the Gooderson family that is offering to buy out minorities feels a tad more generous now that a signed agreement for the R10.5m sale of the SanRock Resort &amp; Conference Centre in Modimolle has been secured.The revised buyout offer of 85c/share comes after rumblings of discontent among smaller shareholders who deemed the pitch to be cynical and opportunistic.Whether the higher offer placates resistant minorities remains to be seen. The offer significantly undercuts Gooderson s latest (and downward revised) tangible net asset value of 133c/share. Minorities won t have missed that in the latest interim period the hotel assets generated R5.8m in operational cash flows equivalent to about 5c/share.
