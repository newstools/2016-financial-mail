Picture: SUPPLIEDYou can mark down October 28 2016 as the day the house changed: Tesla s Elon Musk announced the arrival of the solar roof tile.This is a revolutionary moment because it integrates urban house design with solar technology.This, from news site TechCrunch: "It s easy to dismiss the aesthetic import of how Tesla s tiles look, but it s actually important, and a real consideration for homeowners. The appearance of the tiles, which come in four distinct flavours, is going to be a core consideration for prospective buyers."More about those "distinct flavours": there is Textured Glass, a metallic looking flat tile; Slate Glass, which is very hard to distinguish from traditional slate; Tuscan Glass, the old, curved Italian-style tile; and Smooth Glass.Until now, solar "panels" were ungainly add-ons. But Musk s tile changes the game. He is transforming technological necessity into desirable objects.The schtick is simple: "The sun provides more than enough energy in just one hour to supply our planet s energy needs for an entire year. Your home can capture this free, abundant energy source through rooftop solar tiles, turning sunlight into electricity for immediate use or storage in a Powerwall battery."So you will have solar roof tiles trickle charging your Tesla home battery, which will provide you with green electricity and charge your Tesla electric car.In short, you will become a consumer living inside Musk s vision of the future: an ecosystem that is modern, cool and green. And expensive.
