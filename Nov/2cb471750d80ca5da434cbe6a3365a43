Picture: AFP/CITIZENSIDE/JOSHUA STEINThere is much debate and emotion attached to the #FeesMustFall campaign. This society desperately needs qualified people and we need all the people of SA to be able to maximise their contributions to build our beloved country. We need to enable those with the potential to obtain degrees that will benefit the economy, whether they be rich or poor, black or white.To this end we ought to align education subsidies with the demands of our economy. Why should a taxpayer subsidise a student who takes a degree for which there is little or no demand ?Government wants all those earning less than R600,000 to have free education. Why not have a phased approach in which the higher one s income, the lower the subsidy?Perhaps the most pressing issue is why some student should have, say, R400,000 spent on subsidising his or her education when there are countless people who struggle to get basic services. Why should these students be so highly advantaged?Justin Reed Durban
