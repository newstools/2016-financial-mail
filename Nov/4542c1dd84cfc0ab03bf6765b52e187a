Pravin Gordhan. Picture: REUTERSAt a time when National Prosecuting Authority head Shaun Abrahams, and his boss show us the very worst in people (Features November 10-16), let us rather reflect on what a remarkable individual finance minister Pravin Gordhan is a truly decent, good (there is a difference) and generous man of principle.We have seen precious few of his ilk in our recent history men and women of substance, courage and integrity and even fewer in these dark days that swirl around us.Gordhan gives us all hope and shows us that we can be a winning nation again.He will say that he is merely doing his job and that he serves specifically at the behest of the president. But we all know that it is much more than that. So much more.I look forward to the day, in the not too distant future, when a grateful nation will be able to properly demonstrate its eternal gratitude and respect to a son of SA.Mark Lowe Durban
