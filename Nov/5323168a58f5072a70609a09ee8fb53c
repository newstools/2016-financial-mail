Picture: ISTOCKA truly first-class week in the quest for transformation in SA cricket. Temba Bavuma s split-second run-out in "one fluid movement" of Aussie dangerman David Warner on day four of the Perth test not only sealed the Proteas dominance but was a piece of fielding to rival Jonty Rhodes legendary diving dismissal of Pakistan s Inzamam ul Haq in the 1992 Cricket World Cup. Bavuma s feat was capped by man of the match Kagiso Rabada, whose five-wicket haul helped SA to a comfortable 177-run win in the first test.Economic Freedom Fighters commander-in-chief Julius Malema appeared in the Newcastle magistrate s court on charges of contravening the Riotous Assemblies Act of 1956, after encouraging people to illegally take over vacant land around the country. Then, as if to open himself to charges of flouting the very constitution he (rightly) slams President Jacob Zuma for undermining, Malema explained: "We are not calling for the slaughter of white people at least for now."
