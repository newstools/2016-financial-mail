Brian Molefe. Picture: BUSINESS DAYThere was drama at Eskom on Thursday as CE Brian Molefe broke down after speaking at length about the former public protector s report on state capture.A very emotional Molefe had to go backstage to compose himself before returning to the podium to continue with the financial results presentation.For a while he continued wiping tears from his face with a handkerchief.Molefe slammed former public protector Thuli Madonsela for not giving him time to respond to allegations of corruption against him and Eskom. We gave the Public Protector 132 files in boxes, of the prepayments to Tegeta and other companies we have done in the past. Then we never heard from her again, said Molefe.The State of Capture report says Molefe exchanged 58 mobile phone calls with members of the controversial Gupta family during the period when their companies were trying to buy a company that supplies Eskom with coal.IN CASE YOU MISSED IT: LIVE BLOG: State capture reportAccording to the report, Molefe was also in the Saxonwold area where the Guptas live on 19 occasions in the three months to mid-November last year.Molefe said this was unfair on him as it painted him as corrupt without affording him the opportunity to respond.
