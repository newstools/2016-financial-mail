Jack Welch. Picture: GALLO IMAGES/AFP/CHEN DSBJack Welch s enthusiastic support for Donald Trump at this week s Discovery Leadership Summit was out of place and somewhat comical.The former chair and CEO of General Electric (GE) said he was thrilled the Republican candidate had sealed the presidential race because he expected him to cut taxes and overregulation. Welch is clearly not a fan of bureaucracy, saying growth will improve if the bureaucrats in Brussels and Washington are removed. Brexit was a perfect example of Britain saying "get me the hell out of here", he said.His comments followed other speakers who took a more grim view of populism la Trump and Brexit.Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington, who recently authored The Sleep Revolution, said Trump displayed characteristics of sleep deprivation, such as incoherence and instability.She was followed by Stanford economist Niall Ferguson, who said Trump s campaign proposals, which included greater government spending and lower taxes, would lead to a two-year boom in the US economy followed by a rising fiscal imbalance, higher interest rates and a rise in inflation.But what troubled most about Welch s views was that they came from a respected and successful CEO. During his time at GE, its market value rose from US$14bn to $410bn. While he controversially cut the bottom 10% of performers annually, Welch gave second chances to people who had the right attitude. "The jerk that ruins companies is ... the guy with the great numbers and bad behaviour," he told the summit to loud applause.
