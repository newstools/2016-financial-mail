Picture: SUPPLIEDIt s official: the Christmas toy craze of the year is the Hatchimal. Think hatch + animal.This is how it works: your Hatchimal arrives as an egg. If you nurture and care for it gently and lovingly, the egg undergoes a transformation.As the marketing says: "When you see rainbow eyes from inside the egg, your Hatchimal is ready to hatch!" Then it hatches to reveal which of the range of Hatchimals is yours.Your work has just begun. Now you must teach the rather sad-eyed, penguin-like creature to "talk, dance, play games and more!"Like all great ideas these days, the Hatchimal is an old idea reborn. Remember the Tamagotchi? It was the semi-cool electronic toy back in the 1990s.Back then, kids were content to have a little plastic item with a screen dangling on a key ring to substitute for a flesh-and-blood creature.The Hatchimal is the Tamagotchi 2.0, taking robotics to another level. It promises to imitate life more closely. You can listen to its heartbeat and if you tap it, it taps you back.The toy is sold out in SA, despite retailing near the R1,000 mark (US$59.99 on Amazon), much to the surprise of retailers. Also surprising is the fact that it appeals to boys and older children it was originally targeted at six- to eight- year-old girls.So there is obviously a market for artificial offspring. If you can find them.
