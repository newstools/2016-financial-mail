The world has a new shopping frenzy and it s much, much bigger than either of these.Singles Day, the Chinese holiday celebrated on November 11, began humbly enough as an anti-Valentine s Day celebration of lack of attachment. The date, 11/11, was chosen because the number "1" resembles an individual who is, well, alone.But since 2009, China s e-commerce players have used the revelry to drum up online sales, effectively morphing Singles Day into an online shopping extravaganza in which people buy gifts for themselves.Alibaba, the so-called "Amazon of China", made sales of more than US$14bn in the 24-hour sale last year. This exceeds the $11.1bn spent online in the US over the five-day period from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, which includes Black Friday, when retailers officially kick off the festive trading season.The e-commerce giant s celebrations for the one-day event this year apart from steep discounts will feature a performance by US pop star Katy Perry, an appearance by former Lakers player Kobe Bryant and a live-streamed fashion show in Shanghai that allows viewers to pre order items as they appear on the catwalk.China is the world s largest e-commerce market, generating revenue of $615bn last year. This is about the same as Europe and the US combined, according to consulting group McKinsey.In founder Jack Ma s quest for retail domination, Alibaba is expanding Singles Day beyond mainland China this year.
