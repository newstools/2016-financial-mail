Group CEO Sipho Maseko posted pretty decent results for the six months to September. Operating revenue rose 21%, HEPS were up 20% and mobile services revenue climbed by 37%, while capital expenditure rose 56% to R3.6bn though return on invested capital fell 0.2%. MTN had a net loss of R2.71/share, revenue up 14% and no subscriber growth, while Vodacom was basically flat. Bad Week State security minister David Mahlobo finds himself in an uneasy position following the rhino poaching documentary that aired on Al Jazeera on Sunday. In it, a self-confessed crime boss, Guan Jiang Guang, claims an association with SA s intelligence chief indeed, that Mahlobo visited his home. Mahlobo denies it, but as union Popcru points out, his alleged association with illegal rhino horn traders undermines the integrity of the very agency he heads. The opposition wants him put on special leave until the matter is cleared up.
