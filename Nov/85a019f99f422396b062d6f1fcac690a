Tina Joemat-Pettersson. Picture: BUSINESS DAYPublic expressions of concern over possible corruption and soaring costs in SA s nuclear power plan have fallen on deaf ears. This appears evident from government s long-expected electricity generation plans, released this week, which provide a blueprint to 2050.Energy minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson presented two documents: the updated Integrated Energy Plan (IEP), which considers SA s total future energy needs, and the updated Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), which focuses only on electricity generation.These plans, which are supposed to be reviewed annually, will guide policy and investments.Despite the slowdown in the economy, which has affected demand, and changes in the costs of technology (renewable energy has become cheaper), for the past three years government has proceeded with the outdated 2010 IRP recommendation to commission 9,600MW of new nuclear power.Concerns have risen in recent months, as reports surfaced of unexplained interactions between politicians, including President Jacob Zuma, and nuclear vendors.Cost estimates for new nuclear power stations range from Eskom s R300bn to R1trillion by other commentators.Joemat-Pettersson says the process of updating the IRP is still under way. The department has devised a "base case" but is still modelling scenarios, which will lead to a final plan. Public consultations will take place in December and January.In the new IRP base case, the major components of SA s energy mix become 31% coal, 30% nuclear, 7% gas, 0% concentrated solar (CSP), 6.6% photovoltaic (PV) solar and 18.1% wind by 2050. Today, it is 81.8% coal, 5.5% nuclear, 1.37% gas, 0.24% CSP, 1% solar PV and 1.84% wind.This implies new capacity in the form of 17,600MW of solar, 37,400MW of wind and 20,385MW of nuclear.Eskom s head of generation, Matshela Koko, says to meet the nuclear deadline of 2037, construction would have to start 10 years before by 2026.The base case assumes electricity demand will rise by 2.17% a year, though for the past few years SA s electricity demand has fallen.The base case assumptions will generate further debate on the contentious issue of costs. Using an 8.2% discount rate, the department presented a levellised cost of coal (with fluidised bed combustion) of R888.54/MWh at a load factor of 86% against R970.81/MWh for nuclear, at a load factor of 90%. The cost of renewables, assuming a load factor of 36% for wind, is R805.30/MWh, while at a load factor of 80%, biogas would cost R1,213.05/MWh.The IEP update admits that "a lack of co-ordinated and integrated national planning for the energy sector has led to underinvestment in much-needed energy infrastructure". It highlights lack of capacity in both electricity and liquid fuels. Its base case for liquid fuels foresees the bulk of supply coming from imports by 2050, with a small contribution from new refineries by 2039, gradually increasing to 10% of the total.
