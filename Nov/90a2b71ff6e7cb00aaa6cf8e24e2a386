Jacob Zuma. Picture: SIMON MATHEBULAEven the fiercest defenders of SA s lame duck president, Jacob Zuma, must get rather tired of witnessing the antics of a man clearly clueless about a constitution he swore to uphold.Last weekend, Zuma spent much time boasting that not only does he know who the offenders in his corruption-plagued administration really are, but that he is biding his time "just watching them".Here, Zuma is admitting to (again) breaking the law. Chapter 7 of the Prevention &amp; Combating of Corrupt Activities Act of 2004 legislation you d think he should know pretty well compels "any person who holds a position of authority and who knows, or ought reasonably to have known or suspected that any other person has committed the offence of theft, fraud" to report it to the police.Yet, Zuma ignores this, despite having sworn in 2009 to uphold the constitution "and all other laws of the republic".Many will say: "So what? It s not like it s the first time Zuma has stomped on the constitution."But in a week in which the auditor-general revealed R46bn had been lost to corruption and irregular expenditure, it s yet another landmark on Zuma s downward spiral in public estimation.When the president so blithely ignores his duties, people should ask whether someone who openly admits to turning a blind eye to crime is fit to hold office.
