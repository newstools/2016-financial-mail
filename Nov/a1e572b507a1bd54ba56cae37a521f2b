Picture: SUPPLIEDIs it me or is there a bit of a culinary spring in Jo burg? For a long time we have all been moaning about the fact that Cape Town gets all the great chefs and the fancy restaurant investors.And yes, Luke Dale-Roberts Test Kitchen in the Cape has again won the Eat Out restaurant of the year award. But good things are happening in Jo burg despite the economic doldrums we find ourselves in and, of course, Jacob Zuma, the man who is in business with the Guptas, making billions, while moonlighting as the president of our fine republic.Ah, Zuma. Methinks he is panicking. Did you see him criss-crossing the country last weekend, telling his supporters he knows who his enemies are and that they are "witches"? What a loser. He claimed that "people who are calling for the president to resign are acting on the instructions of Western countries". What? Which Western countries? Doesn t he know Donald Trump wants him to stay because he makes that guy look remotely okay?No matter. The thing is that Jo burg people are tired of Zuma and know he will soon be history. So they are opening restaurants and feeding us good food.A few years ago I got on the N1 and made the trek to Olivedale to visit Caf del Sol. My friend Maaza Seyoum had been effusive about it. I must confess I wasn t keen. Olivedale isn t Jo burg. It is far-north Jo burg. She was right, though. The food was exquisite, the service excellent.So when my lovely wife heard that the third Caf del Sol had opened a hop and a skip from our neighbourhood she winked and hummed and hawed. My mother-in-law was in town. Why not?Caf del Sol is a family business: Mamma Luciana with her son Ryan and daughter Chiara. For their third restaurant they write on their website: "The name TRE celebrates the power of three three members of our family, our third restaurant, and triangular shapes associated with Art Deco."We went my mother-in-law, my humble self and my lovely wife. The decor is absolutely superb, absolutely Art Deco. It is small and warm. The service could improve, though.We started off with a lovely prosecco just to relax us after a tough day of the president not resigning again. It was superb. Order it if you like that sort of thing. It is the only prosecco on the very impressive wine list.The menu is inventive, not too long, and remains faithful to the gorgeous Italian dishes of the Caf del Sol brand. I had mussels to start while the ladies went for a salmon and springbok carpaccio. All delicious. Perfect.My lovely wife s main was disappointing. It was a rather strange concoction to have on that menu, I must say: calamari and stir-fried angel hair pasta. It didn t work, with the lovely wife commenting that it "tasted like a Chinese dish gone wrong".Fortunately, the rest of the dishes were outstanding. My mother-in-law declared that her porcini mushroom risotto (with peas and truffle-scented oil) was "easily one of the best risottos I have ever had". She hadn t tasted anything like it since she d been in Siena, Italy, many moons ago, she said.I had the "Diga Diga Doo", the establishment s prawn, calamari, salmon and mussels, with a home-made tagliatelle in a prosecco, fennel and cream sauce. My word. Heaven.I am going back this week.--------------------------------**** Caf del Sol TRE Parkhurst Square Corner 4th Avenue and 13th Street Parkhurst Tel: (011) 568-1063--------------------------------***** Mcebisi Jonas **** Excellent *** Good ** Poor * Jacob Zuma
