Anti-Trump protest take place across the US. Picture: GALLO IMAGES/AFP/VOLKAN FURUNCUStock markets, including the JSE, are still puzzling about what to make of the election of Donald Trump to the US presidency.Before the election, 370 of the world s top economists signed a letter slamming Trump s "deep ignorance of economics", taking him to task for spreading lies about tax and trade policies.Now that he s been elected, emerging markets have been hammered. In the past week, the rand fell to a 10-week low of R14.49 to the dollar as investors responded to Trump s talk of a new era of protectionism, and a likely jump in US inflation. The JSE swung sharply, but ultimately has lost about 1% since Trump defeated Hillary Clinton.US banking giant Citigroup says it has already reversed "our preference for [emerging market] assets and also our preference for government bonds over equities".Globally, shares in banks, mines and oil companies may be the biggest winners from Trump s election, as investors believe they could benefit from looser regulations.Mining stocks on the JSE have soared in the past week. Glencore was up 24%, Kumba rose 19.7%, BHP Billiton gained 18.5% and Anglo American climbed 13.7%.The question is, what should investors do in a world where populist leaders with little economic nous are asserting control (as happened when the UK voted to leave the EU in June)?Neville Chester, senior portfolio manager at Coronation, says SA investors shouldn t panic. "Lots of market activity means lots of transaction costs, but in truth the underlying long-term valuations of the majority of companies have not changed materially," he says.Old Mutual Wealth s Henry van Deventer says investors need to remind themselves that it isn t elections themselves that generate long-term returns. "Rather, it is the extent to which global trade can happen inside such a political environment that is key. And when a country s markets suffer because of the latter, global investors will just go to other markets." Still, Momentum Investments warns that emerging markets are likely to feel strain from Trump-era protectionism, which could lead to higher trade tariffs and erode overall returns from investments.But the election of Trump, as well as the possibility of other right-wing leaders such as France s Marine le Pen taking power, has stoked fears that the globalised trade world will be reversed under a new legion of populist, anti-immigrant isolationism.In SA, this raises concerns over the vulnerability of the African Growth &amp; Opportunity Act, even though it was renewed for 10 years just a few months ago.Franklin Templeton Equity s Ed Perks says that while Trump s campaign rhetoric was supportive of bank stocks, a bigger risk stems "from the broader economic destabilisation that could result from his proposed trade policies".Investec s Clyde Rossouw says that, in the long term, the risk of a world sliding towards deglobalisation raises the possibility of higher prices, growing unemployment and poor growth in many countries.However, Chester says that investors have suffered a number of shocks including the bursting of the dot-com bubble, the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and the 2008 financial crisis. "The election of a populist Republican president over a Democrat is not anywhere near the scale of any of these previous events."Old Mutual s Van Deventer says the most important building in Washington isn t the White House it s the Eccles Building, where the Federal Reserve holds its monetary policy meetings."Aggressive interest rate hikes are much more likely to cause a US recession than direct policy changes from Trump," he says.
