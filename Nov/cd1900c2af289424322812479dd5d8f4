Picture: ISTOCKOceana GroupThe state of the world s oceans is one of those worries that niggles away in the back of the mind, but never quite reaches the prominence it would if it were somewhere more visible.What happens at sea tends to stay at sea, until it is captured in a marine conservation documentary that gets everybody proclaiming that something must be done until the next time they fancy some tuna sashimi, at which point the collapse of the fisheries slides into the background.There s little doubt that global greed for our aquatic chums is causing a significant issue, which will only be solved by regulation by agencies with the clout to ensure quotas are enforced, and anybody caught bending the rules suffers the full might of the law. This will level the playing field for an operator such as Oceana, which has been acquiring fishing rights and assets to diversify its operations across different species and geographies.Oceana has had to import significant quantities of frozen fish to satisfy local consumers devotion to the canned pilchard in a period in which the total allowable catch has dropped significantly. The quota for horse mackerel was also lower, while hake and squid remained unchanged and, in a rare piece of good news for the gourmet consumer, the lobster catch actually increased.Overall, Oceana has enjoyed a successful year and is now looking to focus on efficiencies while building a war chest for acquisitions. If responsible operators can thrive in a managed framework, the oceans may stand a chance.Cutting further lossesRobert Burns was firmly of the opinion that the best laid plans of mice and men go oft awry. This will come as little surprise to students of the loveable miniature rodents, whose forward-planning and organisational skills have rarely been regarded as outstanding.When it comes to men, however, you might be forgiven for expecting a little more success at turning a plan into execution, despite the obstacles that the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune hurl in one s direction.However, as the experience of Distribution &amp; Warehousing Network (Dawn) amply demonstrates, it s one thing to smack a plan in place, and quite a different thing to carry it through. Dawn s plan to stem its losses and return to profitability was signed off by the board at the end of June but, sadly for the company, the period that followed brought a further deterioration in its operating environment. Government spending slowed, the building sector suffered from pressure on consumers disposable income, and Dawn s rest-of-Africa operations spluttered along.As a result, the remedial action envisaged in June had to be widened in scope, with branches and distribution centres being closed, plants closed and consolidated, and the retreat sounded from Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique and Tanzania.The departure of the CEO, CFO and a director didn t help, and the net result was a restructuring cost of R255m on top of a core operating loss of R52.1m. Now the hope is that the cuts have been deep enough to work.
