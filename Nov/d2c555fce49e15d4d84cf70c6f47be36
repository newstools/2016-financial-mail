Ben Ngubane. Picture: SOWETANThe chairman of Eskom, Ben Ngubane, has accused the former public protector of making speculative findings against the company in her State of Capture report. Eskom has complied with all legal obligations in its execution of its business, Ngubane said on Thursday.Former public protector Thuli Madonsela says in the report that most of the Eskom board, including Ngubane, failed in its duty of care in its dealings with mining company Tegeta, owned by the controversial Gupta family.Ngubane is fingered in the report for possible conflicts of interest due to his directorship of an energy company. We gave the public protector a total of 42 files based on the questions she had asked Eskom, said Ngubane. Then she went on to make speculative findings against us not based on facts. The former public protector also fingered Eskom for irregularly awarding contracts to the Gupta family, and for apparently favourable payment terms that exposed Eskom to potential financial losses.
