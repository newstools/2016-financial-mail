Picture: THINKSTOCKHas the "Africa rising" story become the "Africa stumbling along" story? This is one of the questions posed after a spate of top-level management departures from African private equity firms.The biggest news was the August departure of Marlon Chigwende, MD and co-head of the sub-Saharan Africa buyout advisory team of the world s second-largest private equity firm, Carlyle. He had headed the US firm s African division since it entered the continent in April 2014 after an initial fund raising of US$698m.Also making waves was a Reuters report that said Standard Chartered was "parting ways" with its Africa head, Peter Baird, as part of a plan to cut its Africa team from 11 to five members.Local private equity players read nothing into these two departures."It s just a coincidence," says William Alexander, Investec Asset Management s Africa private equity investment principal.Says EY Africa private equity leader Graham Stokoe: "There s nothing substantial in it."Indeed, Nigerian financial media report that Chigwende is establishing his own African private equity firm.For Standard Chartered, private equity is unlikely to be top of its agenda after its 1.1bn pretax loss in 2015. What is a priority for the bank is slashing its workforce. Last year 6,800 jobs were axed, with a further 8,200 to go by 2018.Despite economic setbacks in countries such as Nigeria, Angola, Zambia and SA, the appetite for African private equity investment has not evaporated.In 2015, $4.3bn was raised in new funding, the African Private Equity &amp; Venture Capital Association (AVCA) says. This was up from $1.9bn in 2014 and $3.5bn in 2013, and approached the record $5bn raised in 2007.Private equity is attractive for investors seeking African exposure as it offers more stable returns than listed equity does. "Private equity valuations are down, but not as much as listed equity valuations," says Alexander. "Because private equity investors look through the cycle, there is less volatility."African private equity is also capable of outperforming listed equity. A study by EY and AVCA reveals private equity returned 2.6 times more than the MSCI emerging markets index between 2014 and 2015, and 1.7 times more from 2007-2015.However, last year s fund raising is likely to represent a peak for some time. "It can t go on at last year s pace," says Alexander. "There is a lot of cash still to be committed to investments."Reflecting this, private equity deals came in at only $2.5bn in 2015, down from a record $8.1bn in 2014, according to AVCA.Private equity investors must also expect to hold investments much longer, EY and AVCA note.The average holding period jumped from five years in 2014 to 6.1 in 2015.As important is the ability to exit at the end of a holding period. Here the situation is positive. The number of exits has risen from 16 in 2009 to 31 in 2014 and 28 in 2015.There is another positive sign: "Fewer companies are being sold back to their management," says Stokoe. "It shows the market is maturing."
