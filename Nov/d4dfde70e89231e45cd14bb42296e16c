1. A robotic futureMost of us relish the idea of a robot that is programmed to do our laundry. But what of those that will take the place of humans in the vehicle manufacturing line? That reality is close, and it has alarming consequences.A UN report says robots could replace as much as two-thirds of workers in developing countries. This will also erode these countries labour-cost advantage, which could drive business back to wealthier nations.2. Zimbabwe s cash crisisAs Zimbabwe waits for the release of new bond notes this month, which it hopes will alleviate its cash crisis, its government has repaid an outstanding International Monetary Fund loan. The payment ends a suspension of technical assistance to Zimbabwe. But it doesn t mean the country will get fresh loans. It will first have to clear its US$1bn debt to the World Bank and another $600m owed to the African Development Bank.3. An Asian super grid ?Entrepreneurs in Asia are hedging their bets on renewable energy, which they say is cheap enough to justify an energy grid that can connect, say, a solar plant in China s Gobi Desert with power-hungry European nations. Japan, South Korea, China and Russia signed a memorandum of understanding in Beijing last month to begin plans for a "super grid" for Asia. Their vision for 2050 is a grid that can connect the entire world. It s a formidable plan. The larger the web becomes, the more stable supply will be, they say.
