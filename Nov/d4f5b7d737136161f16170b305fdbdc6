Picture: ISTOCKIf you re looking for evidence of how difficult economic life is for people on the streets, look no further than the retail sector.One after the other, the major retailers that have published their performance in the past few weeks have all repeated the same dire story: the consumer is under severe strain. Clothing stores, in particular, attest to the fact that disposable income has all but dried up.The most recent to report on this gloomy situation was no-frills retailer Mr Price. A rising star for investors for years thanks to its savvy cash-retailing model, Mr Price s revenue edged up only 1.5% in the six months to October. The net result was a 14.4% drop on the bottom line, with investors also taking an 8% knock in dividend payment in the period.The situation wasn t much rosier at Woolworths, where group sales increased 8.9% in the 19 weeks to November 6. Strip out the 7% price increase for the clothing division, and you see just how gloomy it really was.However, this is the most telling statistic: R10m invested in the retail sector in August is now worth only R7.2m. Mr Price stock, for example, has plunged from R240 to R130 in three months. It is further evidence that outside the blue light cavalcades and swish boardrooms, real South Africans are struggling in a way they haven t for years.
