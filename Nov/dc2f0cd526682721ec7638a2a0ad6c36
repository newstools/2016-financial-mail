The Aspire S13 is one of Acer s latest ultrabooks a slim, portable, high-spec laptop. This is a 13.3-inch model big enough to comfortably work on, but not too big to carry comfortably. It weighs about 1.3kg.The design is attractive: super slim tapering profile with metallic accents. I love the look of the white review unit it feels minimalist and striking at the same time but I did find the feel of the "nano-imprinted exterior" a bit plasticky. It s meant to make it easier to grip, but it does affect the tactile experience. Fortunately, the smooth metal hinge feels premium, so the overall impression is still high-end.An advantage, in my book, is the quality of the screen. It doesn t have the highest pixel density, but it is full HD (1920 x 1080), sharp and colourful. The nonreflective finish makes a remarkable difference to the viewing experience. This matte screen will be one of the first things you notice, and then keep noticing and appreciating as you put in the hours on this device.The S13 has a USB 3.1 Type-C port for fast data transfers, and for charging supported devices, as well as the regular array of two USB 3.0 ports, an HDMI port, audio or earphone jack and SD card reader. The power connection is surprisingly tiny a feature I mention specifically because the charging cable that comes along with it has also been slimmed down.That makes it easier to drop both in a bag and go. Even if you leave the cable behind, though, the S13 promises up to 13 hours battery life.The version reviewed had an Intel core i7 processor, 8GB RAM and a 512GB SSD. It was up to every typical workday task I threw at it, including comfortably managing multiple programs. It comes with Windows 10 installed, and a month s trial access to Office 365. All in all, this is a high-value laptop at a not-so-eye-watering price of R15,999.Acer Aspire S13 Cool factor *** Usability ***** Value for money ****
