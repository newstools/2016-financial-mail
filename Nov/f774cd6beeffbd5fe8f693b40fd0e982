Picture: ISTOCKCafflanoCafflano Klassic is a compact little coffee brewer that can replace a whole kit of things, including grinder, mug, dripper kettle and filter. This travel mug-sized gadget incorporates those components, and they all slot or screw into one convenient package. It s imported, and the price reflects this, but it has earned something of a cult following since launching on Kickstarter early last year.For the perfect cup, put whole beans into the hand mill grinder and, well, grind. Then add some hot water for infusion; the drip kettle component holds 270ml. Remove the dripper, and voila! No more sad instant at your desk or on the road.Oh and no need for filter paper either.Selling point: Delicious drip-brew coffee on the go Price: About R1,900 -----------------------------------------------------------------------AeroPressBefore there was Cafflano, there was AeroPress. This was the "big new thing" on the market about a decade ago, but it s still a favourite in "cupping" (coffee tasting) circles. AeroPress uses two tubes, one sliding into the other, to force the ground coffee through a filter by means of air pressure.It s not only fast this way; the manufacturer promises that this method delivers less bitterness and acidity, as well as zero coffee grounds in your cup.It is a bit fiddly, unlike a classic French press. But the results are great, and the dent on your wallet is significantly less than with the Cafflano. However, you will need to buy AeroPress-specific filter paper (R90 for 350 filters) or a reusable metal disk filter (about R340) for a greener approach.Selling point: Fast, great coffee Price: R650-R700-----------------------------------------------------------------------Brewista smart coffee scaleThis option is a little more hi-tech . It is battery powered and comes with six different modes, for espresso, pour-over and manual methods.It s not "smart" in the way we ve begun to use the word since the dawn of the Internet of Things. But it does easily handle weight and timing, and in doing so takes the guesswork out of the pursuit of the perfect cup.It s great for professionals or serious coffee snobs.Selling point: Accurate weight and timing Price: R1,599-----------------------------------------------------------------------Barisieur alarm clockNow this is interesting: a drip brewer (for coffee, or tea if you must) that kicks into gear when your alarm clock goes off, promising piping hot, dripper coffee on hand at a prescribed time, and without the need for you to leave your bed.Plus, it s all worked into a designer clock that makes for a vaguely "sciencey"-looking package that is simultaneously sleek and attractive, and a bit terrifying.Sadly, though, the Barisieur is still in preorder phase on Indiegogo. But that shouldn t stop a true coffee aficionado now, should it?Selling point: Wake up to drip-brewed coffee Price: US$299 plus shipping
