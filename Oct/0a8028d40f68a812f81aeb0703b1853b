The foundations laid by democratic SA s first two public protectors empowered her to take the office to new heights, says the ever- gracious Thuli Madonsela.Speaking at her farewell dinner in Midrand, Madonsela said Selby Baqwa, the first protector, appointed by President Nelson Mandela in 1995, and Lawrence Mushwana, the second and her immediate predecessor, had left a firm foundation for her.Dismissing criticism of their independence, she said being an ombudsman was a very "lonely job".Under Baqwa, the office began with only 200 cases a week, which were investigated and processed by fewer than a dozen staff members. Today, the office deals with more than 24,000 cases a year, Baqwa s handling of the Sarafina 2 theatre production scandal led to criticism that he shielded then-health minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. His term concluded in 2002, but not before he began dealing with one of the ANC s biggest corruption scandals, Oilgate. Baqwa urged remedial action by parliament against then-mining minister Penuell Maduna, for accusing the auditor-general of helping to cover up a R170m theft of oil from the strategic fuel fund.However, the ANC did not take kindly to Baqwa s stance.Mushwana succeeded Baqwa in 2002. But his tenure was also dogged by criticism that he d been too soft on the ruling party on the Oilgate scandal.When Madonsela took office, President Jacob Zuma urged her to act without fear or favour. Zuma, at the time, had just received a helpful ruling from Mushwana over the corruption allegations he faced before being elected ANC president.Zuma had complained to Mushwana s office about the then-Scorpions probe into the arms deal. But Mushwana found that statements by former national director of public prosecutions, Bulelani Ngcuka, about there being a prima facie case of corruption against Zuma , were damaging to his image.In 2009, Mushwana left with what some reports said was a R7m golden handshake.Madonsela said her predecessors had also had resource constraints, which hampered their jobs. In the end, she said, the investigators in her office were the real heroes.
