Busisiwe Mkhwebane. Picture: GALLO IMAGES/CITY PRESS/JACO MARAISNew public protector Busiswe Mkhwebane s first test will be how she handles the report on "state capture" compiled by her predecessor, Thuli Madonsela.Madonsela, on her last day in office last Friday, decided it would not be ethical to release the report until the interdict against the report sought by President Jacob Zuma had been heard.The report, which many think is politically explosive, was dispatched to the speaker of parliament for safekeeping. It was delivered to Mkhwebane on Monday, when she met her management team for the first time.During meetings held throughout the day, Mkhwebane reportedly told staff she would bring her "own methods, vision and ideas" to the job.However, doubt was cast over Mkhwebane s commitment to tackle corruption in high places when she said on television, before taking office, that "state capture" was not her priority, but that cases involving the plight of ordinary citizens would be her main focus. But after her handover meeting with Madonsela, the new public protector said the state capture report would indeed be "prioritised".Lawson Naidoo, director of the Centre for the Advancement of the SA Constitution, says Mkhwebane should be given the chance to prove herself and to shape the office in her image, as Madonsela had done, particularly as she was coming into a large organisation that is now even more politically charged due to the state capture report.The report details allegations and findings into the role, influence and reach, within Zuma s administration, of the Gupta brothers.Mkhwebane (46) was born in Bethal, Mpumalanga, and matriculated there. She has a BProc and LLB from the University of Limpopo and a master s in business leadership from Unisa. She was a senior researcher at the SA Human Rights Commission before becoming a senior investigator in the public protector s Gauteng office from 1999 to 2005.She has served in the SA embassy (immigration services) in China and as a director in the department of home affairs. In June, she left home affairs to take up an apparently more junior job, as an analyst with the State Security Agency (SSA), the national spy body.The DA, which argued in parliament that Mkhwebane was not the best candidate to become the new public protector, reached the "ineluctable conclusion that she was on the payroll of the SSA". This was "problematic in the current climate of the country, where the justified view is held that President Jacob Zuma is abusing state departments, the SSA in particular, to hold on to power at all costs".Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema has said anyone with proof that Mkhwebane was a spy should come forward. Though the EFF gave her the benefit of the doubt and voted for her, it would push for her removal should evidence emerge that cast doubt on her motives.There are a number of yet to be completed reports with the public protector s office, which Mkhwebane will now oversee. Among them is an investigation into the Gupta family s landing of a private plane at Waterkloof Air Force Base, the Ciex report into missing apartheid billions, and the second part of Madonsela s explosive report into corruption at the Passenger Rail Agency of SA.Asked before she left what advice she would give her successor, Madonsela said the office had three urgent requirements: appointing a chief investigator (which she likened to a chief operations officer); to put in place an electronic case management system; and a project management system, to deal with each investigation as an individual project with timelines and deliverables.While, for the public at large, the biggest challenge on Mkhwebane s desk is the state capture report, her first milestone will be delivering the office s annual report in parliament this week.
