What it means: In standing up for truth, Madonsela has helped to protect the constitution and become a role model for public servants.SA is at present a little like the children of Israel lost in the desert, said Thuli Madonsela in an interview with the Financial Mail a week before her term as public protector ended.It is not unusual for Madonsela, SA s third and most admired holder of that office, to use biblical analogies, So it was fitting that at her last press conference, on Friday, she was thanked "for being my David against the Goliaths of government", by a whistleblower whose wrongful dismissal from a state agency she had exposed. (The description was first used by chief justice Mogoeng Mogoeng in his constitutional court judgment upholding Madonsela s Nkandla report.)Nor is it surprising that she draws inspiration from the biblical heroine, Esther, whose essential message was courage and perseverance in the face of the powerful.In March, the constitutional court upheld the role and power of her office in its ruling on the Nkandla matter, in which President Jacob Zuma, after two years of obfuscation had to pay back a portion of the R246m taxpayers money used to pay for security upgrades to his private residence.It was a victory for Madonsela, but far more important, for the rule of law and the future of the chapter 9 institution.Discussing her "epic" seven-year term, Madonsela in her soft, measured voice contemplated the difficulties faced by SA.A pernicious phenomenonShe may not have known then that her final week in office would once again place her in the firing line. Late last week Zuma sought an interdict against her report on "State Capture", her final act as protector of the public interest, while his cronies the Gupta brothers fought to silence her. She would have been perfectly within her rights to release the report, but decided that would not be right until Zuma s case had been heard."Just because we deal with underhanded people it doesn t mean we, too, should be underhanded," she told reporters.In her interview with the Financial Mail, Madonsela spoke movingly about SA s worrying trajectory: "I think we are on the brink of something, and we are at a point where many things have not gone according to the SA constitutional dream ... A lot of things have gone well, but we are at a place where I would say we are in some respects like the children of Israel, lost in the desert. I honestly feel there is a sense of loss."It was 10.30pm. Madonsela had earlier hosted a conference on good governance in Midrand, then hurried to meet Zuma where he was expected to answer her questions on allegations arising from her probe into state capture a pernicious phenomenon that has infected the body politic under Zuma.After a gruelling four-hour meeting, which did not go at all as planned, Madonsela arrived in Sandton for a public-speaking engagement. She was still jovial as she settled in for our interview, despite the late hour and the frustrations from her meeting with Zuma.Executive interference in state institutions and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) has dominated SA political discourse in recent years. Governance at SOEs will also be key for ratings agencies when they review SA s investment grade in the next few weeks. Madonsela investigated irregularities in SOEs including the Passenger Rail Agency of SA (Prasa) and the SABC, and her findings continue to reverberate.She faced harrowing threats to her office, and last year even appealed to the public to protect it. She was also accused by her deputy of nepotism, favouritism and flouting regulations, but these allegations never stuck.Chapter 9 institutions [established under the constitution to guard democracy] as well as the courts have "stood the test of time", she said. "I always say to investors when all else fails, trust the judiciary, the chapter 9 institutions (such as the public protector and the SA Human Rights Commission), which have stood firm, but particularly the auditor-general, a 100-year-old organisation which has done very well."Under her, the public protector s office has become a fearless crusader against corruption and cemented its independence.'Saved the party from itself'A wry smile played on her lips when she recalled how ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe, at her farewell dinner, said she had often "saved the party from itself" and told her that even when the ANC criticised her publicly, it agreed with her in private.This suggests the ruling party s once frosty relationship with her has warmed. Not long ago, Mantashe accused her of timing the release of her Nkandla report in March 2014 to weaken the ANC in the elections that May.But despite the hammering she endured from ANC leaders at Luthuli House and in parliament, to which she reports, Madonsela always maintained her grace and poise.Mantashe s latest words were "extremely heart-warming," she says.Madonsela was born in Soweto in 1962, the daughter of informal traders. She was among the "struggle funeral groupies" at the Regina Mundi Church when she was recruited to the ANC by a friend at the funeral of Neil Aggett, the doctor and union organiser who died in detention in 1982.The ANC is her political home; she has never been part of any other political organisation. But she would not take Mantashe up on either of his propositions to her that night: marriage, and to become the ANC s first female president."I have no political ambitions; justice is my calling," said Madonsela, who graduated with a BA in law at the University of Swaziland in 1987, and finished an LLB at Wits in 1990. She was part of the team that drafted SA s new constitution and, before becoming public protector, was a member of the SA Law Reform Commission.Her approach to the job of public protector was to create a "purpose-driven organisation" in which its mandate was championed at all levels. She took her job description seriously, and if Zuma thought she d be a pushover he was in for a shock much as his appointment of Mogoeng as chief justice came back to bite him.In 2014, Time Magazine chose Madonsela as one of its 100 most influential people in the world. In his tribute to her, Lamido Sanusi, the Nigerian central bank governor and anti-corruption crusader, wrote: "Thuli Madonsela is an inspirational example of what African public officers need to be ... As SA s public protector, with her ability to speak truth to power and to address corruption in high places, Madonsela has been outstanding."She hopes her successor, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, continues to champion the protector s mandate and that the office remains immune to the crises faced by other state bodies.For example, she said: "The Independent Police Investigative Directorate became an issue about executive interference, the same song that is sung every day in parastatals.One of her darkest moments"In the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) there have been issues about the role of the executive from the time of President Thabo Mbeki."It was the same elsewhere. There have been complaints of executive interference at the Hawks special investigative unit too, and questions over whether the State Security Agency understands its role in society."Are they recruiting people who are looking at state security for the entire state of SA, or people who are looking at one-dimensional issues and forgetting everything else? [The result is that] everything else in society is falling apart, including university fees," she says.One of her darkest moments was when she was absurdly accused by deputy defence minister Kebby Maphatsoe of being a CIA spy . Yet Madonsela, who describes herself as a Christian and spiritual person, took the spy allegation as a blessing because it led to "corporate prayer" for her protection during her travails with the Zuma administration."I really believe in metaphysics: that when we join our thoughts, whether to wish evil or to do good, the universe in my sense it s God hears us better when we bring that energy together. I honestly think that people praying in different places brought that positive energy and whatever people were plotting, something just made them do the stupidest things," she said.Her children quipped that they themselves could have done a better job in framing their mum. (She is a single parent whose partner died in 1997.)The state of SA institutions remains a concern and she urged citizens not to "rest on their laurels". "I always think as a nation we have to look at ourselves and how we have done things and [ask] are our public institutions and appointments focused on the public good?"People who interfere with the institutions should think carefully about what they are doing. "In Sepedi they say, you don t relieve yourself upstream as you are walking downstream because you will find yourself having to drink that water."Madonsela refuses to speak about Zuma s leadership, though he is accused of trying to neuter key state institutions such as treasury, the SA Revenue Service and the NPA whether to secure government contracts for friends or to side-step corruption charges.Another risk which emerged as a result of cases such as Nkandla, Madonsela said, was that when government engaged in criminal acts, it tacitly gave citizens permission to do the same."It is extremely important that people see us as protectors of the law, as guardians of our common heritage, our common resources, our collective power. If they start seeing us unlawfully using that power to enrich ourselves, to protect ourselves, to enrich or protect those close to us, people stop respecting the system."People then look for an alternative, for "self-protection" or, Madonsela quoted Chief Justice Mogoeng, for "self-help". Citizens have to be confident that they can work within the system and attain just outcomes or the system falls apart, she said.Standing up to the presidentBut her final investigation may be the most devastating for Zuma. Madonsela began investigating state capture after receiving three complaints one from the Dominican Order of Catholic priests, one from DA leader Mmusi Maimane, and one from a member of the public. The complaint was centred on, but not limited to, whether Zuma had violated the executive ethics code in allowing private individuals like the Guptas to influence the appointment of cabinet members or the boards of state-owned companies.The issue exploded into the public eye earlier this year, when deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas revealed publicly that the Gupta family had offered him the job of finance minister last year."It makes a mockery of our hard-earned democracy," said Jonas in March.On October 1 Madonsela alerted Zuma to the fact that he would probably be implicated in her report. He agreed to meet to respond to questions on October 6. However, he tried to convince her to leave the probe to her successor as he needed more time to answer her questions. The presidency says Zuma believed the meeting was merely a briefing session and not an interview to be used in the investigation.During that meeting, Madonsela managed to persuade Zuma to respond to the questions by Monday, October 10.Insiders say that despite Madonsela s quiet voice and gentle demeanour, she can be formidable during interviews with those who may be implicated in her reports.Madonsela indicated that her probe suggested the president had violated the executive ethics code, and possibly the constitution by turning a blind eye to the antics of the Gupta family and their business partner, Zuma's son Duduzane.At issue is whether the Guptas influenced the appointment of cabinet ministers and executives at state-owned companies, while scoring preferential treatment when it came to government tenders and trading licences. Claims have been made that appointments to state companies were tied to implicit "quid-pro-quo" conditions which would have benefited the Gupta-owned businesses.Madonsela recommends a way forward, but it will be released only should co-operative governance minister David Des van Rooyen fail to get an interdict against her on November 1.Madonsela stood up to Zuma on a number of occasions and sources say the state capture probe does not pull any punches in terms of his conduct. She has shown herself to be fearless yet there was a hint of reticence in her Nkandla probe where she gave the president the benefit of the doubt on allegations that he lied to parliament about his home, saying it was unintentional. Ultimately, she spared Zuma an embarrassing finding of breaching the Executive Ethics Act.The relationship between Zuma and Madonsela was not always adversarial. Government officials in the security cluster say she was among a handful of bureaucrats trusted by him as he entered the Union Buildings in 2009.She laughs off suggestions that she was in his "engine room", an ad hoc government advisory body, which he consulted at the start of his term. "I have heard that before, I don t know anything about it but I have always been a member of think-tanks, linked to Wits University, for instance," she says.What's next?And academia is where she is headed next, hoping to take up a course for "has-beens" at Harvard next year, and then a teaching post at Oxford. By around 2018, she has all but signed off on starting a social justice centre linked to a local university.Addressing the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation on Saturday, she publicly spoke for the first time in seven years as simply "Citizen Madonsela".While much is falling in SA, the theme of the evening was #whatmustrise, to resolve the pressing questions facing SA at this, its "brink of something".Madonsela said it was critical in SA for "justice" to rise, "not just us".Perhaps, her final act of delivering justice as she moves on to the "next phase of the journey" is answering the questions on state capture, which she admits have polarised cabinet, government and the country."To speak about corruption in high places is often subversive and always embarrassing," Sanusi wrote in his Time tribute to Madonsela. "The machinery of state can be called upon to intimidate or even destroy and eliminate whistle-blowers. It therefore requires extraordinary courage and patriotism to do what Thuli Madonsela has done."Yet in standing up for the truth as she sees it, she has assured herself a place in the history of modern SA and among the tiny but growing band of African public servants giving us hope for the future of our continent."
