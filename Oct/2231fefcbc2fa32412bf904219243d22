What it means: Lake Charles is an $11bn ethane cracker in the midst of shale gas territory, adding size and diversity to synfuels.Fischer-Tropsch is a process developed by two German scientists in the 1920s to turn coal or gas into synthetic fuel, which can be refined into transport fuel. Sasol was the first to build very large-scale coal-to-liquids plants, starting in 1955. In the 1970s, with high oil prices and sanctions, government funding facilitated further expansions.It s all about the sizzle. At least that s the view of a Sasol project manager overseeing the bustle of activity at the group s immense Lake Charles chemicals project site in southern Louisiana, about a two-hour drive from Houston.Explicitly, he is referring to the feats of co-ordination to ensure that over a million line items are available at the exact time they are needed so no-one is kept waiting, and the project doesn t slip further behind deadline.That s become critical.Time is money, and analysts and shareholders back in SA are already unhappy over the steep increase in the project cost now US$11bn (R152bn), which is seriously pricier than the initial $8.9bn shareholders expected.It s a huge gamble for Sasol, given that the price tag for Lake Charles is roughly six times its R24.2bn operating profit for last year.But if it works, it ll transform Sasol from a deveoping market oil company to a global chemicals giant.This means the iconic 66-year-old Sasol you thought you knew the one created by the apartheid government in 1950 to produce synthetic fuels, using coal as a feedstock for the Fischer-Tropsch process will be radically different.By being one of the first in the world to produce synthetic fuels in this fashion, the National Party government believed it would create a fuel supply "not controlled from abroad or by international monopolies and cartels, but by the SA state".Today, of course, Sasol is already vastly different. For a start, it s no longer owned by government, since it privatised and listed on the JSE in 1979.Government owns only 21.1% and Sasol is owned by thousands of South Africans in pension funds managed by, among others, Allan Gray (8.1%), Old Mutual (3.2%) and Sanlam (2.7%). More than a third of its shares are owned by overseas investors in the US, Europe and elsewhere.But Sasol s ambitious US adventure is so bold precisely because of its position as an emerging market oil company in the epicentre of an oil market hurricane.The oil price has plunged from $147/bbl in July 2008 (shortly before the global financial crisis hit) to around $51/bbl today. In the past two years alone, the price has more than halved, from $113/bbl in June 2014.For Sasol to forge ahead with Lake Charles one of the biggest foreign investments yet made by an SA company speaks of either great belief in the project or a foolhardy reluctance to change course.The plan is to build an ethane cracker, which will take the natural ethane found in gas under the ground in Louisiana and "crack" it to produce 1.5Mt of ethylene a year. This ethylene can be used in a variety of commodity speciality chemical products ultimately finding their way into synthetic fibres, soft-drink cans, detergents, paints and food packaging.Once it s up and pumping (by 2019), Lake Charles will boost Sasol s earnings by 35%.Within the first two years, Sasol believes it could begin turning over $1bn in operating profit (Ebitda), which would grow to between $1.4bn and $1.5bn after five years of operation.It s a step change for Sasol, and the culmination of a decade in which Sasol s strategy has been overhauled, making it less hierarchical and more efficient, able to expand globally and into new product.Step into Lake Charles space-age 2km by 4km construction site, and it ll be all but incomprehensible to anyone but an engineer.It s a sea of cranes and trucks, piles of steel girders and pipes, and huge steel tanks, all waiting to be pressed into service.But that doesn t mean it s easy building a mega-project, as the $2.1bn in extra costs (from its initial $8.9bn target) illustrates.It s all been complicated in recent months by rain which the US media labelled "of biblical proportions" comparable to that which caused havoc in New Orleans a decade ago. It took many months to drain a wetland, divert a watercourse, then stabilise the ground.The weather delays and extra site costs added $750m alone, while it had to add another $670m onto its budget for labour costs, as it brought in higher-skilled workers to ensure productivity improves.This plant is being built in the perfect region to access shale gas pipelines and export infrastructure but it is also in the midst of hurricane territory, so foundations have to withstand flooding and high winds.Construction is expected to peak next year, at which time there ll be 5,000 workers on the site. By 2019, Lake Charles will employ 500 full-time staff, earning an average of $80,000/year.With so much money at stake, Sasol cannot afford any further slip-ups.But while the increase in costs has hurt Sasol s credibility, the majority of analysts now rate Sasol a "buy" only because the market has taken an overly pessimistic view of Lake Charles.Analysts at Credit Suisse said the market "is pricing in the worst-case scenario" at Lake Charles, as investor confidence has been dented by the steep rise in costs."With the market s confidence in Sasol management shaken after the recent operational problems at [Lake Charles], management will need to rebuild confidence in its ability to execute such projects and its ability to make the right decision when it comes to capital allocation," it said.Until then, Credit Suisse said, "the market will be pursuing a show me attitude".So if Sasol can finish the project on time, its stock could rocket. Credit Suisse pointed out that many of these similar projects get shunted off course by insufficient planning early on, and too aggressive a schedule.Analysts at Investec said that while they believed the $500m contingency reserve in the $11bn cost was "adequate to complete the project without further overruns", the key risk remained labour productivity.Rather unconventionally, Sasol has made it the job of two men to ensure that the company s credibility remains intact.This is because Sasol, like Standard Bank, now has two CEOs, accounting and MBA graduate Bongani Nqwababa (50), and American chemical engineer Steve Cornell, who is 10 years older.Cornell, speaking to the Financial Mail, says Sasol could have built Lake Charles 10 years earlier, but the restructuring has made it easier to manage.But then it s been a busy decade. Aside from the oil price swings, the company put in place the R25.9bn Inzalo empowerment deal (at the time SA s largest BEE deal). It also underwent a fundamental internal restructuring and began looking overseas.Nolitha Fakude, Sasol s highly rated vice-president of strategy and sustainability (who will leave at the end of this year), provides a flavour of the dramatic cultural changes over the past decade.By 2008, Sasol had 17 different divisions including gas, mining, synfuels and nitro, each organised as a separate unit and with its own culture. Former CEO Pat Davies simplified the processes, standardised the values across the divisions, and pushed Sasol to look at projects in India and China. Sure, Sasol already had global operations, in Qatar, Germany and Mozambique, but Davies had a more ambitious global plan.His key values were safety, people, integrity, accountability, stakeholder focus and excellence.Fakude says the change was big because Sasol was seen as arrogant an intellectual organisation without real people skills. It needed to shift its culture.Interestingly, Sasol remains one of the smartest JSE-listed companies around. It employs 283 PhDs 0.93% of its workforce of 30,500."This first phase was challenging for some employees but it was important as Sasol was moving into other countries with different cultures, often into joint ventures, where engagement with customers and governments made it essential to have respect, trust, collaboration and teamwork," says FakudeIn 2011, when Canadian engineer David Constable replaced Davies as CEO, the process of change had begun. He demanded a high-performance culture and focused on cutting the cost base while laying the foundation for growth. His maxim was: "You have to fix the roof while the sun is shining.""We had to make a case for change even while the oil price was strong. When the price dropped we had to develop an additional response plan to make the organisation resilient in a prolonged low oil price environment," Fakude says.Constable simplified the organisation around a "make, buy and sell" framework. Staff had to move away from a "silo" mentality, where their first priority was their own business units, to one where a single organisation and its bottom line were the priorities. "We identified three or four key culture shifts that were needed: from complexity to simplicity, from silo to collaboration, from an SA focus to a more global focus, and from a command and control mentality to a leadership culture based on mutual trust and respect."Constable focused on three cultural priorities: a "one Sasol outlook", teamwork, and accountability. Project Phoenix, the restructuring programme, was introduced to scrutinise each layer of the workforce, which led to the total number of employees being cut by 15% over three years (excluding growth projects). "We had been watching input costs, particularly labour and electricity, rising faster than revenues," Fakude says.It was a labyrinth of more than 230 legal structures, each with its own committees and auditing requirements which made it difficult to be "flexible and accountable".This was trimmed to 70 structures and management layers were redesigned for maximum accountability.Mandla Gantsho, Sasol s chairman, said in the annual report that the restructuring took place without a single strike.So far, it seems a success. At Sasol s results presentation in August, financial director Paul Victor said Project Phoenix had exceeded targets, with R37.1bn in savings. Victor said the plan was to push for a further R2.5bn in savings by the 2019 financial year.Nor is Sasol the "last bastion of white men" any longer. When Fakude joined Sasol there was only one white woman and one black woman among the company s top 50 executives. Five years later one-third of the top 50 aren t white males and 45% of the executive committee are black. "We believe you have to set the tone at leadership level so all staff understand this organisation is serious about change," she says.The oil-price crunch meant tough choices had to be made. Last year, internal training (other than critical skills and safety courses) was suspended and management salaries were frozen (this has changed from this year).It seems apposite, given the "fees must fall" demands, to point out that Sasol still has one of the biggest training programmes in SA (750 students a year and 1,800 artisans). In total, on bursaries, artisans and staff training, the group spends about R655m/year, of which R50m is on bursaries.This month Sasol also begins shifting its head office from Rosebank to Sandton, Between 3,000 and 4,000 employees in 17 different buildings will move to Sandton.So while it may seem like the "sizzle" is centred on Lake Charles, it s clear this isn t the only locus of energy. Of course, Sasol s future hinges on whether the US gamble succeeds, given that it s nothing if not a complete overhaul of Sasol s raison d tre. If it works, Sasol won t be a primarily liquid fuels company but rather a chemicals company.Last year, Sasol s two chemical segments base chemicals and performance chemicals contributed 60% of group turnover. Sasol s JSE listing was reclassified from an "integrated oil and gas company" to a company in the "speciality chemicals" section.It is far too early to assume Sasol will avoid further cost and time glitches in Louisiana. But at least its new culture will allow it to respond to any glitches faster.And, while JPMorgan said last month that the cost overrun "remains a significant disappointment", it added that "for those who can wait [about] 18 months, there is material upside in Sasol".
