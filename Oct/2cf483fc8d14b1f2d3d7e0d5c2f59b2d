Katlego Msomi and the MD at 4Seeds, Kerstin Jatho, give a Master Class on negotiating power dynamics at work.Social psychologists John French and Bertram Raven identified six bases of power in the 1960s: Legitimate power that of monarchs, presidents and ministers. Reward compensating people for their compliance Expert reflecting one s expert skills or knowledge Referent that a person s attractiveness or worthiness deserves other s respect Coercive punishing subordinates for their lack of co-operation Informational withholding access to information needed to complete tasksJatho says in the workplace, we often see expert power and reward power. The latter tends to be used and manipulated in a negative way when people equate their powerful positions with reward, promotion, incentives and training opportunities.Power is abused for a number of reasons. First, it can be consciously used to manipulate and threaten people to achieve a certain agenda. Second, there is a level of insecurity and low self-esteem in the individual that makes them use power as a facade to reclaim their power. Often, however, people get into leadership roles having not been skilled on how to use that power. This leads to people who have no leadership skills being thrust into roles they do not know how to handle.It is possible to teach ourselves how to deal with power, says Jatho. "You need to understand the implications of power because if you abuse or misuse it, people become very resentful, disempowered, disengaged and you get the contrary of what you want from them. Power does not build respect, power is not leadership."She says employees have to learn to speak up, be assertive and set boundaries without being aggressive or submissive. "Learn to say no to the situation or the task, never to the individual," she says.Jatho gives a few tips on how to use power productively in the workplace.
