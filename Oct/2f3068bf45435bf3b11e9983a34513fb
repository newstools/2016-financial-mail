Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane capped a fine career in the beautiful game when his team clinched the 2016 Confederation of African Football champions league on Sunday night in Egypt. Winning a hostile encounter against four-time champions Zamalek FC makes Mosimane the most successful coach in SA football. The brilliant display also swelled the club s coffers by R21m. It is only the second time the trophy has come to SA. Hopefully, Sundowns success will rub off on the national team, Bafana Bafana.Lewis Group s share price plunged 8% to a seven-year low before recovering somewhat after a trading update by CEO Johan Enslin suggested that the earnings of SA s biggest furniture dealer would drop by as much as 45%. It s not a nice way to end the week, particularly as Enslin is struggling to repair damage to the company s reputation arising from its controversial credit practices as well as various court cases centred on alleged breaches of the National Credit Act, which Lewis disputes.
