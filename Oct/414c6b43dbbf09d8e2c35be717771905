In the five years since Wesizwe Platinum started building the R10.67bn Bakubung platinum mine near Rustenburg, many things have changed.Platinum prices have fallen, causing investors to flee the sector; rand volatility has increased; and several platinum miners have put new and expansion plans on hold.Wesizwe, unlike many other developing platinum miners, is well funded by a Chinese consortium, but it has still had to tweak its plans to conserve its cash. It is now focused on bringing its main shaft into production by the middle of next year and producing its first saleable material by 2019, which is almost two years earlier than originally planned.To do this, it has changed the sequencing of the mine plan and is deferring some of the noncritical surface infrastructure, such as changehouses and parking lots, to the end of the project timeline.Work on the process plant will start in the middle of next year, allowing two years to build up a stockpile of about 1Mt of ore to coincide with the commissioning of the plant in mid-2019.Jacob Mothomogolo, Wesizwe s projects executive, says Wesizwe expects its shaft-head operating costs will be about R580/t, up from its September 2013 estimate of R489/t. Adding about R140/t for processing gives a unit cost estimate of about R720/t. This puts it in the lower half of the cost curve of comparable platinum producers.Since September 2013 , spot platinum has shed about one-third to US$933/oz, partly offset by a 40% weakening of the rand/dollar exchange rate in the same period.In its latest Commodities Compendium, investment house Macquarie says the US Federal Reserve s continued dovish approach towards interest rate hikes next year, coupled with recovering physical demand, will push up gold and silver prices, and platinum investment demand will benefit. But Macquarie expects a real recovery in platinum prices will only occur in the medium to long term as automobile sales, particularly of diesel vehicles that use platinum in autocatalysts, are expected to slow further next year.In the long term, prices will benefit from lack of investment in platinum mines which will be evident not only in falling output but in more frequent safety stoppages, Macquarie says.So far, Wesizwe has spent R2.9bn on items such as electricity and water services, completing the services shaft, starting work on a ventilation shaft and bringing the main shaft near to completion. Another R300m will be spent by the end of the year.There are still some big-ticket items to come, such as R2.5bn on the process plant and R3.5bn-4bn on reef development.Wesizwe has spent the $227m of equity advanced by its major shareholder, China-Africa Jinchuan Investments, and has drawn down $300m of its $650m loan funding.Mothomogolo says another $100m will be used in the first quarter of next year and then drawdowns will be in smaller instalments.Management has decided that for the first 10 years of the mine, Wesizwe will use two contract mining companies to mine on its behalf, while keeping procurement and construction management in-house.It expects to award the first contract in about March next year.Mothomogolo says Wesizwe s current funding will take it into the production phase but it may need to raise either debt or equity later for working capital.At the current share price of about 53c, against a peak of more than R13 in 2007, equity raising is unattractive.Wesizwe s single-largest black-empowerment shareholder was originally the local Bakubung ba-Ratheo community, with 20%, but it precipitately sold most of its shares down to the current level of 4.5%.As a result, Wesizwe s total black shareholding is 20.2%, below the 26% Mining Charter minimum requirement.Hamlet Morule, corporate affairs executive, says Wesizwe has held discussions with the department of mineral resources and the Bakubung community about adding another 6% to the community s stake.A definitive proposal has been submitted to Wesizwe s board; however, it has not yet been finalised.
