Pravin Gordhan Picture: GCISFinance minister Pravin Gordhan has for the first time confirmed that he was interviewed by former public protector Thuli Madonsela in the so-called state capture report.The report, which Madonsela finalised and signed off before the end of her seven-year term mid-October, has been mired in legal uncertainties, with President Jacob Zuma interdicting Madonsela from publishing the report in the second week of October, two days before her term in office was due to expire. Yes, I was interviewed by the public protector, Gordhan said, speaking to a group of chief executives at the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in Sandton on Friday afternoon.Asked what the public protector had interviewed him about, Gordhan said that would be for the office of the public protector to publish in the report.The state capture investigation looked into whether there was an inappropriate relationship between the president the controversial Gupta family and other state officials.Other than his deputy Mcebisi Jonas, Gordhan is the first cabinet minister to confirm that he was interviewed by Madonsela for the state capture report, which focused on whether the Guptas had undue influence over Zuma s choice of ministers.Jonas was the first member of the executive to accuse the Gupta family of having offered him a job, that of finance minister, while Nhlanhla Nene was still in office. Vytjie Mentor, a former member of parliament, was another prominent person who came forward publicly with allegations of being inappropriately offered a cabinet position by the Gupta family. She also testified in the state capture report, and said Zuma was on the Gupta property when she was offered the position.The Guptas have denied all the allegations.Nene was inexplicably fired in December last year, and David Des van Rooyen was appointed finance minister, a position he occupied for four days, before being replaced by Gordhan.Jonas has said he was offered millions of rand in cash by the Guptas to accept the job, before Zuma had offered it to him.In his first day in office, Van Rooyen reported for work at national treasury with two advisers, both with links to the Guptas.Zuma has asked the high court to interdict the public protector from publishing the report, which may have dire political consequences for him. He maintains he was not given enough opportunity to contribute to the report, and to question those who have implicated him in their testimony.
