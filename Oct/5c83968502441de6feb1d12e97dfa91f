Picture: THINKSTOCKPSG Gloom and despondency may be stalking the land as it is steered from iceberg to iceberg by the Gupta family and their puppet muppet, and as we watch the universities struggle to complete the academic year.But a glimpse of the performance of PSG should be enough to lift the spirits of its shareholders, at least.For everybody else, PSG s success offers a salutary example of what business can achieve if it is allowed to do what it does best without the dead hand of political intervention.PSG has been instrumental in the rise of two of the great investment stories of the millennium, Capitec and Curro. The company has supported them with liberal helpings of capital where necessary, but has also given them the room to grow and their executives the space to run their businesses.The opportunities may be evident with the benefit of hindsight Capitec has taken advantage of the big banks difficulties in addressing the demands of the low-cost market and Curro has fed off the shambles of the government education system but the execution has proved near flawless.PSG s sum of the parts valuation continues to grow at speed, despite generally dismal economic conditions, and the big question is what will be the next rabbit to emerge from its rather substantial hat. It describes its private-equity operation as an incubator to find the businesses of tomorrow and it is sitting on R1.7bn of cash to hurl at whatever targets might pop up.It s not clear what the next chapter of this remarkable story will be, but it s unlikely to be dull. DiamondCorp A flurry of Sens announcements from DiamondCorp demonstrates just how fast things are moving down at the Lace diamond mine.First came a technical update on the production ramp up, detailing tonnage constraints due to large slabs of kimberlite falling all over the place, with obvious safety concerns. This means that tonnage will be restricted to 15,000t/month until about February, when it should be up to full production of 30,000t.The very next day there was a shock announcement that the mineral resources department had slapped the mine with a section 54 shutdown notice as a result of a fire on a dump truck that was extinguished without injury. It s clear from the tenor of the announcement that the company thinks the department has lost the plot, particularly in its insistence that DiamondCorp call in an external ventilation audit team to inspect the mine for smoke and other gases.This is expected to shut the mine down for at least a week, and it couldn t have come at a worse time for the company.The final missive came on Friday, announcing that the company s talks to arrange a convertible debt facility had fallen apart due to the adverse movement in its share price. It is scrambling to raise the 500,000 that it needs to satisfy its immediate financial commitments, and if it is not successful then the lights are off and it s goodnight Vienna.The Grim Reaper is sharpening his scythe, and it will take some decidedly fancy footwork to keep him away from the door.
