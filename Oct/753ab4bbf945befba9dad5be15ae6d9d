Picture: ISTOCKWhen his rape accuser, known to the public as Khwezi, died last week, President Jacob Zuma may well have been relieved. His less than circumspect sexual behaviour had recently resurfaced as a public issue and with Khwezi gone, he might hope for one fewer front on which to fight the many battles of his imploding office.But while sex-related scandals have taken a back seat to claims of other forms of corruption in Zuma s life, across the Atlantic, US presidential hopeful Donald Trump is having to deal with the fallout of his own sleaze.Both men spend a fortune on lawyers. In Trump s case that fortune may be his own; Zuma s legal fees, however, come from SA s public purse and inevitably affect its shrinking size. And though both men appear addicted to litigation, their tastes differ in the finer details.For a brief spell early on, Zuma tried to muzzle the media through defamation actions, but since changed tack when it became obvious he would not win.Instead, he has concentrated on litigation as a blocking device to keep himself out of the dock in the criminal trial he should have faced long ago. Trump, on the other hand, seems obsessed by the idea of suing for libel though just the threat to sue apparently excites him almost as much.Just as Zuma was hit hard by the re-emergence of the Khwezi rape spectre during a post-election protest in August, so Trump s barely concealed sexual voraciousness bubbled out of the sewers in recent days. The release of a decade-old tape with its explicit boasting by Trump of his predatory moves against women sparked revulsion among many. But it also prompted numerous women to come forward and speak of their own experiences of Trump s lecherous behaviour, two of them in interviews published in The New York Times.Apology wantedTrump s lawyers, Kasowitz Benson Torres &amp; Friedman, immediately wrote to the newspaper, calling the story "reckless and defamatory" and "nothing more than a politically motivated effort to defeat Mr Trump s candidacy".Failure to withdraw the story and issue an apology would leave Trump with "no option but to pursue all available actions and remedies", they said.Commentators warned that this was a gambit Trump might regret, as it opened the opportunity to grill him under oath. Indeed, the NYT took up the challenge with glee, shooting back a letter which the US legal blog "Above the Law" remarked must have been "one of the happiest billable hours in the life of an NYT attorney".Trump wanted the article removed and a full apology issued, but, said the NYT s lawyers, "We decline to do so."While a libel claim is meant to protect one s reputation, Trump had bragged about his "nonconsensual sexual touching of women and intruding on beauty contestants in their dressing rooms," and agreed to a radio host s request to discuss his own daughter as a "piece of ass". "Nothing in our article has had the slightest effect on the reputation that Mr Trump, through his own words and actions, has already created for himself."But there was a larger and more important issue, said the letter. It would have been a disservice to the women involved and to "democracy itself" to silence their voices."We did what the law allows: We published newsworthy information about a subject of deep public concern.If Mr Trump disagrees, if he believes that American citizens had no right to hear what these women had to say and that the law of this country forces us and those who would dare to criticise him to stand silent or be punished, we welcome the opportunity to have a court set him straight."That s a lesson Trump, like Zuma, is in constant need of reminding.It s called Democracy 101.
