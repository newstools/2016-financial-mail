Picture: ISTOCK1. Back off, says EuropeA Chinese buying spree has the Europeans running scared. Germany has called for Europe to control foreign investment in its companies, shortly after news that Chinese acquisitions had hit a US$207bn record. The protectionist stance comes months after Kuka AG, a German firm that assembles Airbus jets, was purchased by China s Midea. Germany s economy minister this week reopened a review of the takeover of equipment supplier Aixtron by China s Grand Chip Investment.2. Runners: win by a noseAn injured knee is nothing to sniff at. But there may be an end in sight for damaged joints. Researchers at Switzerland s University of Basel have taken cells from the noses of 10 patients with damaged knee joints and grown them into cartilage grafts. These patches were surgically implanted into the patients knee joints.Two years after the procedure, most patients had developed new tissue similar to normal cartilage and reported improvements in knee function, decreased pain, and a better quality of life.3. The president s handMalawians can t be faulted for not paying attention. When President Peter Mutharika (76) returned from a weeks-long visit to the US, he used his left hand to wave to a crowd of supporters and to shake hands, though he is right-handed, and didn t hold a press briefing. His presence put a quick end to the hashtag #BringBackMutharika and rumours of his death but have done little to dampen speculation about his failing health. It has left the public wondering whether Mutharika would continue to run the country via Skype, as his spokesman recently claimed from the US.
