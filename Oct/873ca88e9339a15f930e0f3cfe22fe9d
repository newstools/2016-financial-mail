Chinese rules weigh heavy DANONE / Danone reported its slowest third-quarter sales growth in more than a decade amid a slowdown in baby food, traditionally one of the company s fastest-growing businesses. China has raised taxes on foreign infant formula sold online after concern over product safety created a boom in such purchases.

Total sales fell to US$6.1bn.
