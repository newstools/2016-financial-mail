Foxcroft. Picture: CLAIRE GUNNForget gritty Woodstock or trendy Bree Street. It s now the turn of the streetlight-less burbs to acquire one of those restaurants that prompt competitive restaurant-goers to make panicked booking phone calls. That s right, Constantia has nabbed Cape Town s hottest new place to eat. And it s not even on a wine farm though there is a vineyard connection.Foxcroft is the latest addition from La Colombe executive chef Scot Kirton and the culinary team of his long-standing pastry chef, Glen Foxcroft Williams. The restaurant is already heaving most evenings, but it is open for lunch and sports a bakery too.It s a slick but relaxed operation, with a set dinner menu that allows you to select any two tapas dishes, one main course and a dessert.The tapas include champagne-poached oysters, which alone are probably worth the drive to the Southern Suburbs.Make like Cape Town s foodie cool kids and order the confit pork belly or beef ribeye for mains with boutique local wine, naturally.Jo burgers, we reckon this is one of those restaurants you need to cue up for your December trip to the Mother City.
