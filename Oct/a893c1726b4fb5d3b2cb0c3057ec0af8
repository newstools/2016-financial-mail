Cyril Ramaphosa. Picture: BUSINESS DAYIt will be touch and go as to whether the package of labour stability reforms, which includes a national minimum wage, will be concluded by the national economic development &amp; labour council (Nedlac) in time to influence SA s upcoming sovereign rating reviews.Horse trading between the social partners business, government, labour and the community is likely to go down to the wire, with compromises required from all sides.On Saturday, at a lengthy Nedlac committee of principals meeting, broad agreement was achieved on most of the technical task team s labour relations stability documents, including on a new code of good practice.The aim of the code is to try shift behaviour by setting out guidelines on acceptable conduct during collective bargaining, industrial action and picketing. Though the code is not binding, it can t be ignored without good reason.The code is bolstered by an accord, which is a declaration by the social partners against violence and damage to life and property.At the meeting, deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa commended the "astounding" progress made by the labour stability technical task team, which has met 17 times between January and September.However, the committee of principals did not agree on all of the task team s proposals. Outstanding sticky issues include legislative amendments to provide for secret strike balloting, as well as nonbinding "advisory arbitration" when strikes spiral out of control or become excessively prolonged.Nedlac has four weeks to not only finish this process, but also to agree on a national minimum wage (NMW) if it is to influence Moody s next ratings review of SA on November 25 and that of Fitch and S&amp;P Global Ratings on December 2.A comprehensive report on the NMW is expected from an advisory panel by the end of November, the presidency said in a statement. It expects to convene another committee of principals meeting before the end of November to receive the report and finalise the labour stability reforms.If SA fails to deliver some good news to S&amp;P, which is poised to downgrade the country to junk, it will be a great pity, given the constructive engagement that has happened at Nedlac over the past 18 months.According to business and labour representatives, the adversarial tone in Nedlac has changed, as all parties have come to realise that they have to make significant shifts for the national good."There is greater recognition by all social partners ... that the economy and business is not in a good space," says business s committee of principals member Sim Tshabalala."There is also greater recognition that business and employment are interconnected and mutually dependent."Dennis George, secretary-general of the Federation of Unions of SA, echoes this, saying: "We are working together faster and better now." He is optimistic that all the labour reform issues can be wrapped up before the end of November.Having travelled on two international roadshows with finance minister Pravin Gordhan this year, George credits the leadership of Gordhan and the direct involvement of CEOs under Telkom chairman Jabu Mabuza for this rapprochement.Ramaphosa s negotiating skill and seniority have also been vital in keeping the process on track as has the fact that government is fielding a full team, including the departments of finance, economic development and trade &amp; industry, not just the department of labour as before."Government is leading policy formulation and playing a more integrated role, considering the impact on the labour market, economy and society," explains Tshabalala. In fact, the importance of stimulating employment, particularly youth employment, in a climate of stagnating economic growth and high unemployment has been recognised by all the social partners.Describing the technical task team negotiations on labour stability as "remarkably constructive", Tanya Cohen, business s representative on the task team, says that "for the first time in many years, Nedlac s doing what it s supposed to be doing."Nedlac spokesperson Kim Jurgensen says this is partly because the council has overhauled its secretariat to provide better support to the social partners and has fast-tracked internal processes. This includes specifying a maximum turnaround time of six months for any engagement, including on new pieces of legislation."We ve put in place as many measures as we can to make things more efficient so the social partners can see they re not coming here to the policy graveyard," she says.In 2012 Nedlac was meeting only about 30% of its performance targets. This year, it will meet close to 95%.In addition to greater operational efficiency, "the social partners feel there is a window of opportunity and they need to step up it can t be business as usual," says Jurgensen.This stands in sharp contrast with the adversarial mood that characterised the four labour law negotiations that commenced in 2008 and resulted in a significant tightening up of SA s labour dispensation by 2013.As the head of Business Leadership SA at the time, Michael Spicer finally threw in the towel in 2012. "Sitting in Nedlac is soul destroying," he explains. "You know nothing is being achieved. It s all distributive bargaining, very far from the idea of let s all pull together for the sake of the economy. "The turning point was the violent, five-month platinum strike in 2014 the longest and most expensive strike in SA history. The damage to the economy and workers livelihoods, and the loss of life, forced SA to take a hard look at its fraught industrial relations environment. The Nedlac reforms are the result of this process.Business Unity SA CEO Khanyisile Kweyama feels that if the labour stability provisions are adopted, "they will mark a decisive shift towards achieving labour relations stability" in SA.They would also be pivotal in restoring investor confidence, as agreement would signal that SA has acknowledged that the current state of affairs is not sustainable and that the social partners can work together to address this.
