The company said the sale was to settle tax obligations following the exercise.Executive director Dion Ramoo sold 39 ,712 shares, at a weighted average price of R171.84, for R6.8m . Non executive director Danny Mackay offloaded 45,600 shares, at a weighted average price of R166.77, for R7.6m.Since EOH s establishment in 1998 by CEO Asher Bohbot, the company has consistently outperformed its rivals, some of which have fallen off the radar screen.
