The US presidential race is now Hillary Clinton s to lose, mostly thanks to Donald Trump s self-destructive streak.Trump, the Republican Party s nominee, is behind in several "battleground" states and, almost incredibly, the Democratic Party s Clinton is close to overturning his lead in Republican states such as Texas, where she is only four points behind.Trump s lack of traction among women voters in swing states is growing, after the leak of a tape in which he bragged about groping and kissing women against their will.Trump still has a loyal fan base, but he may be the first Republican candidate to lose the support of voters described as "white, college-educated males".What to do? The Trump counteroffensive has two prongs. His wife, Melania, is being pushed to the front of the campaign. She told television news channel CNN tellingly without her husband at her side that he had been indulging in "boys talk" and had apologised to her for it.The second prong is to attack Clinton where she is weak. Trump s best shot is to paint Clinton as a Washington insider, part of the cosy alliance of politicians and bankers that brought the financial crisis.He may have some material to work with like the fact that Clinton told fundraisers at a Goldman Sachs event that the banks were best placed to regulate themselves.
