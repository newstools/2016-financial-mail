Aerial view of Sasol construction site in Secunda in 1980.What it means:Oil price outlook steady; chemicals offer re-rating; projects present risks; new management to be proven.Conventional wisdom has it that you buy Sasol s shares as a hedge against the cost of petrol. The idea is that if the petrol price rises, at least you ll get that back in the Sasol share price, because it makes its money selling fuel.But this notion has unravelled, as the volatile rand, government taxes and transport costs played havoc with the maths. Since Sasol hit a high of R640/share in mid-2014, its stock has slid 38% to about R397. Throw in dividends, and the net loss is still a third .True, this is less than the 41% drop in the rand price of Brent crude oil in that time, but Sasol s stock has fallen a lot further than the marginal 10% drop in the price of 93-octane unleaded petrol, which now costs R12.34/l. In other words, your Sasol shares are down plenty, and you re still paying a heap of money to drive your car.Sasha Naryshkine, fund manager at Vestact, says if investors want a perfect correlation to the oil price, they should buy an index-linked product, not Sasol shares.The problem is the swings of the global oil market have been too much for many investors. The outlook is unpredictable, as fracking companies become more efficient and can respond faster than oil companies.A decade ago, it was the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) that set oil prices; today, Opec has less power. All of which suggests oil prices are likely to stay low for a few years.The World Bank, in its latest Commodity Markets Outlook, says oil prices are likely to average $43/bbl this year (slightly up from its previous forecast of $41/bbl) thanks to supply shortages and robust demand. For the next three years, it sees prices settling between $53 and $60/bbl. This means triple-digit oil prices like $147/bbl in July 2008 are unlikely "any time soon", as Saudi Arabia has relinquished its swing producer role and the US shale oil industry is setting prices instead.Sasol, however, is hoping its share price recovers as it gets a greater chunk of its revenue from a burgeoning chemical business a business less cyclical, with higher margins.There s certainly scope for that.At a price:earnings level of around 9.6, Sasol is far cheaper than global rivals like Dow Chemicals (p:e of 15), Air Products &amp; Chemicals (22.6), BP (17.4) and Chevron (40).Hanr Rossouw, a fund manager at Investec Asset Management, says Sasol s rating is comparable to developing-market oil groups in Russia and Brazil, even though its business differs from those operating oil rigs.Over the long term, though, Sasol s p:e has averaged around 10, suggesting it is now cheaper than its long-term average.The recent weakness reflects worries over the cost overruns at Lake Charles.Precisely because it s cheap, 43% of the analysts who cover Sasol rate it a "buy" and 37% a "hold". On average, they expect it to hit R428.25 over the next 12 months about 8% above its current level. In part, this reflects the market s perhaps overly pessimistic view on further cost overruns at Sasol s Lake Charles project in the US, as well as the fact that it did better than expected in slashing operational costs.JPMorgan says Sasol s "overdelivery on cost savings bodes well" and should help boost its credibility after it overshot spending at Lake Charles.Investec analyst Jarrett Geldenhuys says the results show that even if oil stayed at around $40/bbl, Sasol was able to deliver "robust earnings and cash flows".At the current oil price of $51, in other words, Sasol will do just fine.But the scepticism about Sasol isn t entirely due to Lake Charles. Analysts at Macquarie Research remain neutral, pointing out that Sasol has had a disappointing decade of low returns, reaching a historical low of 6.6% return-on-equity this year some distance below the 35% of 2001.Part of the reason, it says, is that "Sasol has impaired assets (and equity) to the value of R32bn in the (past) nine years"."We remain concerned that potential earnings downgrades as well as uncertainty around the (Lake Charles) project could affect the share in the near term," it says.Brokerage Credit Suisse, in a research note, argues that Sasol s main competitive advantage over the years was its access to cheap feedstock (it owns coal mines) and its preferential status in SA. "Sasol has now embarked on an international growth phase ... trying to export its technological competitive advantage to other markets. However, what concerns us is that ... Sasol s true competitive advantage lies in its access to cheap feedstock, whereas in the US, the company will be subject to market forces with regard to feedstock ethane prices."Sasol has other battles to fight. In May, Moody s placed Sasol s rating on a "negative outlook" because its credit profile is so closely aligned to SA s economic prospects, as well as the weak oil and gas environment.On the plus side, Moody s said, was Sasol s "well-entrenched, market-leading position in liquid fuels and chemicals in SA; integrated value chain and business model underpinned by proprietary technology; and robust cash flow generation with prudent and conservative management policies."On the negative side was its sensitivity to the rand, execution risk at Lake Charles, plus the usual political and inflation risks in SA.Ultimately, it seems Sasol s share price will be driven by what happens in the US and often-unpredictable ethylene prices.Moody s analyst Douglas Rowlings is cautious about prices in the US chemicals market into mid-2018. "Almost 7Mt of ethylene capacity will come on stream in 2017, constituting an 18% increase in North American capacity, with additional supply likely to put downward pressure on prices."Still, Sasol s joint CEO Bongani Nqwababa doesn t appear overly concerned by competition from other ethylene producers, as rivals like Dow, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips are taking similar steps."Given our estimates of global economic growth and demand for our products, we are comfortable," he said in an interview.Analysts also raise the issue of having two CEOs. Any fallout between the two, and project oversight could suffer. But at Sasol s recent results presentation, Nqwababa and co-CEO Steve Cornell said the model was working well: both were involved in all aspects of the business and have not divvied up responsibilities.They meet daily or, when travelling, communicate at least once a week. "It helps that we both have manageable egos," Nqwababa said.JPMorgan seems to agree; its analysts say "there is a refreshing absence of ego (and) it doesn t look to us as though the individuals are likely to fall out or that the company will end up being run with separate silos".Given the immense challenges at Lake Charles, that s reassuring.
