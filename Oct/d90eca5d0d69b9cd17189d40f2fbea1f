Kuben Naidoo. Picture: FREDDY MAVUNDAA court case to air the reason that SA banks closed the accounts of the Gupta family-owned Oakbay Investments will be a good thing, says Kuben Naidoo, deputy governor of the SA Reserve Bank and registrar of banks.It would give banks a chance to explain their behaviour."I think that would be in the public interest," Naidoo tells the Financial Mail, after finance minister Pravin Gordhan filed an application to have a court declare that, as finance minister, he is not by law empowered or obliged to intervene in the relationship between banks and their clients.The claim by Oakbay, after banks closed its accounts, that he should intervene are harmful to the financial sector, existing regulations and the autonomy of regulators and banks, Gordhan says in an affidavit.Oakbay Investments announced in April that Absa, FNB, Nedbank and Standard Bank had closed its accounts. It accused the banks of collusion and a "sustained political attack" on the family."The related controversy has received national and inter- national attention, and it is clearly in the public interest, the interest of the affected clients and relevant banks, and employees of both that it be authoritatively resolved," Gordhan says in his affidavit.The respondents in the matter include 14 Oakbay companies, the four banks, Reserve Bank governor Lesetja Kganyago, Naidoo and the director of the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC), Murray Michell.Gupta family attorney Gert van der Merwe argues that it is an abuse of process.He says it s unnecessary to approach a court, as there is no dispute on what Gordhan s legal obligations are."It must be deduced ... that there was an intention to achieve something other than superfluous legal relief. I think it was to attempt ... to bring the transactions between a company and its bankers into the public domain, and that is not what a court is for," Van der Merwe says.Gordhan s application reveals that, between December 2012 and June 2016, banks reported to the FIC "suspicious and unusual transactions" (in terms of the FIC Act) totalling more than R6.8bn, which were associated with Gupta-related companies and individuals.Van der Merwe, who hopes the matter is referred to trial, says there s nothing suspicious about the transactions in question. He will prove as much to the court, show there is an abuse of process on the part of the minister and ask for a costs award, he says.Having elected not to approach a court to resolve their disputes with banks previously, this week the Guptas said they were "delighted" with Gordhan s application. "The truth always comes out in the end and we look forward to clearing our name in court."Banks declined to comment, but it is likely that a court will require them to reveal reasons for closing Gupta-linked bank accounts.
