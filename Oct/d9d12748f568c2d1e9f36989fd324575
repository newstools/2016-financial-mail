Mike Flax.At least three new property listings are heading for the JSE, including a R1.4bn Western Cape-based portfolio owned by entrepreneur and former Redefine Properties director Mike Flax.The other two contenders are retail-focused Liberty Two Degrees and a UK-based property play by global asset manager Schroders.Flax is no stranger to the JSE. He listed his first Western Cape-based property portfolio, Spearhead Property Holdings, in January 2000.The company was sold to Redefine six years later in a deal worth more than R1bn.After spending five years at Redefine, Flax left in 2011 to return to his forte of development and trading.He has since assembled another Western Cape-based portfolio with partners Quintin Rossi and Abu Varachhia.The R1.4bn portfolio, comprising 25 office, industrial and mixed-use properties located in and around Cape Town, will be listed under the banner of Spear Properties on November 11.Flax, who is known for his shrewd entrepreneurial and deal-making skills, concedes he was keen to take a sabbatical from corporate life when he left Redefine in 2011. But the fact that unlisted property funds don t qualify for the same tax benefits as listed funds makes it difficult for private property players to recycle their portfolios."The JSE s [real estate investment trust] legislation is a big driver of our proposed listing. Raising capital in the market will also give us the ammunition to become a dominant player in the Western Cape," says Flax.He hopes to tap the market for R300m in a prelisting capital raise, of which more than half (R187.5m) has already been committed via a private placement.Spear Properties will have an expected market cap of R830m at listing and offer a forward dividend yield of 8.3%, which appears attractive compared with the sector s 7.5% average.
