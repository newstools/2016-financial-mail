Piet Mouton. Picture: HETTY ZANTMANOnce again, PSG Group CEO Piet Mouton kicked off an investor presentation by reiterating that the company had "been good with early-stage investments" and that the private equity arm will be the nursery for new investments.In this way, Mouton reminds investors that it is perhaps not advisable to ignore the smaller, more peripheral, components of PSG s portfolio. But with 90% of PSG s value lying in its four big listed investments, PSG Private Equity (PPE) remains the company s corporate Cinderella.In fact, it is PSG s enormous successes in start-up investments like Capitec Bank and private education specialist Curro that makes it easy for investors to overlook PSG Private Equity (PPE).Admittedly, PPE is small. PSG s total sum-of-the-parts value sits at around R51bn, with PPE representing a sliver of value at around R1.8bn.But there are signs that PPE is gaining significant traction in developing its 10-strong investment portfolio, and it might now be possible to pick the next big winner(s) for PSG.PPE s recurring headline earnings for the six months to end-August shows them 6% up to almost R50m. More importantly, the sum-of-the-parts valuation grew 24% to over R1.72bn.PPE CEO Nico de Waal points out that no investment in the private equity hub is less than three years old. "These investments have enjoyed significant time and energy from us, and we feel the portfolio is starting to build up a head of steam."The portfolio consists of two listed investments outsourcing company SCG Holdings and communications technology group Alaris.The eight unlisted investments are arguably more interesting, consisting of distance-learning company Impak, e-learning platform ITSI, power management services company Energy Partners, Botswana-based fast-moving consumer goods company CA Sales, mining services group Precrete, leverage buyout specialist Spirit Capital, Stellenbosch Nanofiber Company and insurer African Unity.The three standout investments which must be candidates for JSE listing in the next two to three years are Energy Partners (56% owned), Impak (83%) and ITSI (62%).De Waal says Energy Partners, which offers a variety of energy provision and saving applications, is profitable. Insider talk at PSG suggests Energy Partners could be listed in two to three years.Impak and ITSI might be better looked at as a combined private education alternative which, if half as successful as Curro, could pay off big time for PSG.De Waal says Impak recently turned profitable off a base of 13,000 learners in schools and tutor centres. He believes strongly that Impak s individualised self-directed learning model is scalable in a total school market of 2.4m learners. The longer-term target is 100,000 learners by 2020, with high operational leverage expected to drive strong future profitability.De Waal says Impak is weighing up acquisitions, but perhaps more encouraging is that there are signs of early interest from public schools. The ITSI e-learning platform which costs R40 per learner per month has 43,000 learners. Like Impak, its potential for tapping into the public school market is vast.De Waal reckons ITSI could sign up as many as 100 new schools next year.A shift into tertiary education is also being mulled, with a pilot project under way at the University of Pretoria, and the first offshore venture set to be tested in UK schools next year.If sentiment remains robust for private education ventures on the JSE, there may be some justification for PPE to accelerate plans to list the alternative education operations.Though the energy and education assets inside PPE are likely to attract the most attention, there is talk that PPE might surprise with a dual listing of the R3bn-a-year business CA Sales on the JSE and the Gaborone bourse.This might be pre-empted by a series of acquisitions.
