If the quality or sincerity of what Jacob Zuma actually says when he does speak in parliament, answering questions or making a policy address is any guide, it won t matter a jot if he never goes back. Yesterday at questions he tried to strike a serious tone by referring to the nine-point plan he came up with in his 2015 state of the nation speech to parliament. It is supposed to be the guiding hand behind his last few years in office. But yesterday, when MPs asked him questions about his plan, it was clear he couldn t remember what was in it, leading to a hilarious string of jokes on social media and deepening the hole into which he is gradually sinking. Zuma will soon run out of the time and road to orchestrate his own succession, let alone finish his term.
