Brined and non-brined. Injected salt solution makes chicken look better. Picture: FINANCIAL MAILYour lead article "Salt in the Wound" refers.The entire debate about chickens, and the attempts to justify this, seems limited almost exclusively to the economic implications. The devastating effect of increasing salt in our diet is well-known and deliberately adding high concentrations of salt to quick-frozen chicken pieces, which forms an integral part of the diet of the poorest of the poor, is completely unacceptable.Our black population is particularly susceptible to high salt intake and the resulting high blood pressure, with an increasing incidence of heart disease and stroke.Is by ignoring this and just looking at the economic interests of the big chicken producers not a disguised form of racism? As in Brazil, the brining of chicken should be totally banned.Stan Brighton Sedgefield
